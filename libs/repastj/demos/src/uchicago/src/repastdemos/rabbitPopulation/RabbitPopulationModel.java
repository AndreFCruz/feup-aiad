/**
 * This is an example model demonstrating how to use the CEquation and CEquationFactory classes 
 * to create system dynamics type models. This particular simple model of a rabbit population is based on that
 * described in http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM5/D-4432-2.pdf.
 * 
 * The general idea here is to link the CEquations together so that the variables in one equation are 
 * the results of another. For example, population = population + (births - deaths) * dt. When this equation is
 * evaluated the value of births and deaths are the results of a previous evalutation of the births and deaths 
 * equations.
 * 
 * This model encapsulates the equations in classes (psuedo-agents) and associates them with one another via the
 * classes' init methods. The classes and the equations they encapsulate are listed below:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>RabbitPopulation : population + (births - deaths) * dt
 * <li>Births : population * birthRate
 * <li>Deaths : (population / lifeTime) * deathMultiplier
 * <li>PopulationDensity : population / area
 * <li>DeathMultiplier : graph-type table lookup (0.00, 1.00), (100, 1.00), (200, 1.00), (300, 1.00), (400, 1.50), 
 * (500, 2.00), (600, 2.70), (700, 3.70), (800, 4.70), (900, 5.70), (1000, 7.50)
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The simulation proceeds by first evaluating and assigning the births, deaths, and population density equations. 
 * In the process of the evaluation these objects will query the population for its current value. The 
 * population equation is then evaluated and assigned. In doing so, the population equation will query the births
 * and deaths objects for the result of their evaluation. So, in short, we first calculate the number of births and
 * deaths based on the previous years population, and then use that data to calculate the new population.
