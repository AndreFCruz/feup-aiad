/**
 * A partial implementation of Randal Picker's Endogenous Neighborhood
 * game as described in his as yet unpublished "Endogenous Neighborhoods and
 * Norms." This simulation extends prior work by Randal Picker. See "Simple
 * Games in a Complex World: A Generative Approach to the Adoption of Norms",
 * 64 University of Chicago Law Review 1225 (1997). Thanks to Randal Picker
 * for allowing us to include this with Repast.
 *
 * Batch version of the EnnModel - virtually the same, but without any
 * display classes, and an arbitrary run stop at 200 ticks
