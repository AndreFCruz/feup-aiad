/**
 * Base class for EnnModels. The gui model (EnnModel.java) and the batch
 * model share common behavoir and state. This class encapsulates
 * these shared qualities.
 *
 * A partial implementation of Randal Picker's Endogenous Neighborhood
 * game as described in his as yet unpublished "Endogenous Neighborhoods and
 * Norms." This simulation extends prior work by Randal Picker. See "Simple
 * Games in a Complex World: A Generative Approach to the Adoption of Norms",
 * 64 University of Chicago Law Review 1225 (1997). Thanks to Randal Picker
 * for allowing us to include this with Repast.
 *
 * Here agent's
 * play a coordination game with their neighbors and receive a payoff. After
 * all agents have have played the game, then each agents determines whether
 * the current location and strategy meet their aspiration, changing strategies
 * and moving if necesary. As described in the paper, satisfied agents
 * can play a strategy of "strategy upgrade" or "pure aspiration". Here only
 * strategy upgrade is implemented. Playing this strategy means that a content
 * agent finds the best average strategy of all its neighbors and plays this
 * the next turn. Unsatisfied agents can have a strategy of either move and
 * change
 * or change first. A strategy of move and changes means that an agent moves
 * a random distance in a random direction and then changes its stratgey to
 * the best average strategy of all its neighbors. Change first means that
 * an agent changes its strategy and then if still unsatisfied, changes
 * to a move and change strategy the next turn.<p>
 *
 * These values can be changed as initial parameters before a run<br>.
 * PURE_ASPIRATION = 0<br>
 * STRATEGY_UPGRADE = 1<br>
 * CHANGE_FIRST = 2<br>
 * MOVE_AND_CHANGE = 3<br>
 *
 * See the playGame method of EnnAgent for the details of the strategies.<br>
 * See SugarModel.java for more on the general structure of a simulation model
 * file.
