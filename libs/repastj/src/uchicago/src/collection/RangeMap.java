/**
 * A Map whose keys are doubles and whose values are Objects. Objects are
 * inserted with an implied range, relative to the other objects inserted.
 * So,<br>
 * <pre><code>
 * map.put(0, obj1);
 * map.put(.5, obj2);
 * map.put(11.2, obj3);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * associates obj1 with the range [0, .5) (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of .5),
 * and obj2 with the range [.5, 11.2) and obj3 with [11.2, pos_infinity).<p>
 *
 * Getting an object is done with a key as in other types of maps. However,
 * here the object returned is the object within whose range the key falls.
 * So, <code><pre>
 * map.get(.25);
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * will return obj1.<p>
 *
 * The data structure used here is redblack tree implemented without
 * removal. The implementation is largely a port of the C++ code in
 * Mark Allen Weiss, _Algorithms, Data Structures, and Problem Solving
 * with C++_.
