   *
   * Creates a random network from the specific parameters. The network is
   * created by assigning a degree to each node. This degree is a random number
   * drawn from a Normal distribution whose mean is specified by avgDegree and
   * whose variance is specified by variance. A new random number is drawn
   * for each node. Some number of nodes, that is rows in matrix speak, are
   * randomly seeded such that a number of links are created for that node
   * equal to the specific degree for that nodes.<p>
   *
   * The created network tries to approproximate a realistic network using the
   * edgeProbability array. The first member of this array specifies the
   * probability that if A -> B, then B -> A. This is ignored if the network
   * is to be symmetrical (i.e. isDigraph is false). The remaining members of
   * this array specify the probabilities that a one node will link to another
   * node a walk of length n away, where n is the nth member of the array.
   * So for example, if the 2nd member (index 1) of the array is .2, then
   * nodes have a .2 probability of forming a link with another node a walk
   * of length 2 way. In order to take into account that a node is more likely
   * to link with another node if it has multiple walks of length n to that node
   * and if it has walks of other length to that node, the probilities are
   * multiplied and added in the following manner:
   *
   * <code><pre>
   * if
   * (i_intended_vec_sum / avgDensity) * (((matrix_size / avgDensity) *
   * (1 - Sum(probs[n]))) + (probs[0] * matrix^2_ij) +
   * (probs[1] * powArray^3_ij) + ... + (probs[n] * powArray^n_ij))
   * >= uniform_float_from_1_to_0
   * then
   * there is a link
   *
   *
   * where:
   *      i_intended_vec_sum = the intended row sum as determined in step 1.
   *      avgDensity = the user specified mean degree
   *      probs[] = an array of probilities that specify the likelyhood of
   *      one node having a link to another. This array is indexed to the
   *      various matrix powers such that the first probility refers to the
   *      likelyhood of one node having a link to another if that node is
   *      a walk of length 2 away, and so on for the other powers.
