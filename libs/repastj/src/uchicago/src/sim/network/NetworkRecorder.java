/**
 * Records a network as a matrix or matrices in the appropriate format.
 * NetworkRecorder is used to take a list of Nodes and write the corresponding
 * adjacency matrix to a file. Three file formats are supported: UCINet's
 * dl, Excel, and ASCII. The actual network matrix is written out in this
 * format, although RePast records relevant non-matrix information as well:
 * a file header containing the constant parameters for the model and a
 * timestamp, and a block header that contains header information relevant
 * to the network data recorded beneath it. The block header will contain
 * the value of any dynamic model parameters at the time a network
 * was recorded, as well as any user comments (typically the current tick
 * count).<p>
 *
 * The actual format of the file is thus:
 * <code><pre>
 * file header
 *
 * block_header_1
 * network data in the specified format
 *
 * block_header_2
 * network data in the specified format
 *
 * ...
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * Specifying the format then specifies the format for the network data. The
 * rest (file header and block header) will remain the same for all formats.
 * The actual network data can easily be cut and pasted out of the file.<p>
 *
 * ASCII format will record the matrix and the matrix label in comma
 * delimited plain text. Excel format will store it in an Excel file
 * in a format suitable for importation into UCINet.<p>
 *
 * <b>Note</b>: Excel format should not be used as it is very time consuming
 * and error prone to write to an Excel file. Use ASCII instead which
 * is a plain text format suitable for importation into excel.
