/**
 * A discrete 2 dimensional hexagonal torus of objects, accessed
 * by x and y coordinates.<p>
 *
 * The hexagonal cells are referenced by x, y coordinates as follows:
 * <pre>
 *       _
 *   _ / 1 \ _
 * / 0 \ _ / 2 \
 * \ _ / 4 \ _ /
 * / 3 \ _ / 5 \
 * \ _ / 7 \ _ /
 * / 6 \ _ / 8 \
 * \ _ /   \ _ /
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here we have a 3 x 3 hexagonal grid. The first row of cells is 0,
 * 1, 2 such that 0,0 refers to cell 0, and 0,2 refers to cell 2. The
 * next row of cells is 3, 4, 5, so 1,0 refers to cell 3 and so
 * on. The last row of cells is 6, 7, and 8, so 2, 0 refers to cell 6.
 * The ring of neighbors with radius one that surrounds cell 4 is
 * composed of 1, 2, 5, 7, 3, and 0. The grid wraps as a toriod such
 * that cell -1, 0 refers to cell 2 and cell 0, -1 is cell 6.
