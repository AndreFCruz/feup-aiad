/**
 * Records Objects to files as Strings. ObjectDataRecorder will
 * record Objects together with an optional String comment. Typically, this
 * comment will be the tick count, but need not be.<p>
 *
 * In non-batch mode, a file header will be written that includes all the
 * model's properties and the values of these properties. These values
 * will be the value at the time the first call to write is made, allowing the
 * user to manipulate the parameters after setting up but prior to running the
 * model. Consequently, your initial model parameters should only be
 * changeable via the user or through a parameter file. If not, the file header
 * may be inaccurate. The actual data will be written as a block where the
 * block includes the optional comment as a header, followed by the String
 * representation of the Object itself.<p>
 *
 * In batch mode, any constant model parameters will be written in the
 * file header. The data block will include the value of any dynamic
 * parameters, the run number, as well as the optional comment (again,
 * typically the tick count), together with the String representation of the
 * Object to be recorded.
