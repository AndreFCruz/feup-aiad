/**
 * Executes within a parent <code>Schedule</code> and manages the
 * execution of <code>BasicActions</code> according to an internal clock.
 * A SubSchedule allows a user to further divide the ticks of a parent
 * Schedule by some specified number. Certain aspects of the model can
 * then occur "faster" than other elements.<p>
 *
 * A SubSchedule is typically scheduled against a Schedule to execute at some
 * tick t. When the SubSchedule exectutes at t, it then iterates over its
 * own scheduled actions a specified number of times. So, for example,
 * a SubSchedule may execute all its actions three times for every tick
 * of its parent Schedule.<p>
 *
 * The actions scheduled on a SubSchedule will iterate with a simulated
 * concurrency (i.e. in random order). If the actions should be executed
 * in some specified order, the actions should be added to an ActionGroup
 * set for sequential execution. This ActionGroup can then be added to
 * the SubSchedule for execution. Specifying the order in the
 * scheduleActionAt and scheduleActionAtInterval methods can be used to
 * insure that certain actions occur after other actions.
