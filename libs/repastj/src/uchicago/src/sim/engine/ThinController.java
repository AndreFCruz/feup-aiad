package uchicago.src.sim.engine;

/**
 * Provides minimal (thin) controller support for running a simulation.
 * ThinController is intended to provide batch-like non-gui programmatic control over
 * a simulation for those who want to do batch type runs without using
 * RePast's batch run mechansim. Thin controller thus provides methods to
 * start, stop, pause and exit a simulation, but virtually nothing else. In
 * particular loading parameters into a model is not done here. Loading
 * parameters using some sort of custom parameter file or mechanism will have
 * to be done elsewhere.<p>
 *
 * ThinController can be used in conjuntion with a tool like Drone (drone.sf.net)
 * where an instance of the model and a controller are created for each run
 * of the model. The main method of a model might then look like:
 * <pre><code>
 *  public static void main( String[] args ) {
 *    MyModel model = new MyModel();
 *    ThinController controller = new ThinController();
 *    model.setController(controller);
 *    controller.setExitOnExit(true);
 *    controller.setModel(model);
 *    model.addSimEventListener(controller);
 *    // custom parameter loading here ...
 *    ...
 *    control.startSimulation();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * @version $Revision: 1.10 $ $Date: 2004/11/03 19:50:57 $
