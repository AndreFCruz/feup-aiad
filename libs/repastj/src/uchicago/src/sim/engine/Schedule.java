/**
 * Manages the execution of BasicActions (ActionGroups,
 * SimActions, and SimListActions) according to a simulation clock. The clock
 * is incremeneted at the completion of the execution of all the BasicActions
 * scheduled for execution at that clock tick. A Schedule is itself a
 * BasicAction and so Schedules can be added to other Schedules.<p>
 *
 * The actions scheduled on a Schedule will iterate with a simulated
 * concurrency (i.e. in random order). If the actions should be executed
 * in some specified order, the action should be added to an ActionGroup
 * set for sequential execution. This ActionGroup can then be added to
 * the Schedule for execution. Specifying the order in the
 * scheduleActionAt and scheduleActionAtInterval methods can be used to
 * insure that certain actions occur after other actions.
