 * This interface can be used for a more advanced <i>stepping</i> pattern for
 * agents.  This steps agents in 3 increments, first in the preStep (normally 
 * for setting an agent up for the next step, next in the step (normally for 
 * doing the bulk of the agent's actions), and finally in the postStep 
 * (normally for cleaning up after a run, swapping buffers and so forth).<br/>
 * 
 * Each method can throw @{link #Exception}s, allowing for stopping of the model
 * when an agent can't complete an action.
