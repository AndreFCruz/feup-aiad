/**
 * Descriptor for model properties/parameters that can be represented as a
 * closed list. A ListPropertyDescriptor can be used to present the user
 * with a drop-down combo box containing a list parameter values of which
 * he or she can choose one. It can also be used to represent a list of one
 * type as a list of another type - a list of ints as a list of strings for
 * example.<p>
 *
 * There are several ways to set up a list of parameter values to be displayed
 * by the combo box. A vector of Objects, an array of Objects or a hashtable
 * can be passed when the ListPropertyDescriptor when it is constructed. In
 * the first two cases combo box displays the vector or the array, and
 * passes the chosen object to the appropriate set method when combo-box item
 * is selected. In the case of the hashtable, the values of the hashtable
 * are displayed by the combox box and it is the key of the selected value
 * that is passed to the appropriate set method. This allows for
 * the display of natural language words representing numeric constants.<p>
 *
 * A ListPropertyDescriptor is typically setup in the constructor of your
 * model. For example,
 * <code><pre>
 *  Hashtable h1 = new Hashtable();
 *  h1.put(new Integer(0), "VON NEUMANN");
 *  h1.put(new Integer(1), "MOORE");
 *  ListPropertyDescriptor pd = new ListPropertyDescriptor("NType", h1);
 *  descriptors.put("NType", pd);
 * </pre></code>
 * A ListPropertyDescriptor is created with the name of the property, and a
 * hashtable as an argument. The property name must reflect the standard
 * get/set accessor method coding style. In above case, the model has two
 * methods getNType and setNType. Given the name of the property a
 * ListPropertyDescriptor will call the appropriate set method when an
 * item in the combo box is seleted. The second argument is a hashtable
 * whose keys are the actual objects that can be selected and passed to the
 * set method as well as a string representations of those objects.
 * In the above case, the hashtable contains two keys: an Integer with a value
 * of 0 and an Integer with a value of 1. The value of these to keys' are
 * the Strings "VON NEUMANN" and "MOORE" respectively. What the user will see
 * then is a combo box labeled as "NType" that contains two Strings "VON
 * NEUMANN" and "MOORE". When the user selects one of these strings, the
 * corresponding Integer is passed as an argument to the setNType method.
 * Descriptors is an instance variable (a hashtable) of the SimModelImpl class
 * and can be used by sub classes.<p/>
 * 
 * This class's widget is a PairComboBox or a PropertyComboBox.
