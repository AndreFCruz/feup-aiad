/**
 * Descriptor for a model's boolean properties/parameters. Using a
 * BooleanPropertyDescriptor allows a boolean property to be represented
 * as a on/off checkbox in the properties panel.<p/>
 *
 * A BooleanPropertyDescriptor is typically setup in a model's constructor
 * as follows:
 * <code><pre>
 * BooleanPropertyDescriptor bd1 = new BooleanPropertyDescriptor("RecordData",
 *     false);
 * descriptors.put("RecordData", bd1);
 * </pre></code>
 * <p/>
 * This property descriptor describes the RecordData property/parameter of
 * some model, and thus assumes that the model contains a setRecordData
 * and a getRecordData or a isRecordData method. A BooleanPropertyDescriptor's
 * constructor takes a the name of the boolean property, and the default state
 * of that property, in this case false. The BooleanPropertyDescriptor is then
 * placed in the hashtable "descriptors" (an ivar of the SimModelImpl class).
 * When the model parameters are displayed in gui mode, the RecordData will
 * then be displayed as a check box.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * This class's widget is a PropertyCheckBox.
