/**
 * A property descriptor for limiting an integer value to a specified
 * range. A RangePropertyDescriptor is a descriptor for a parameter /
 * property whose value can be expressed as falling within a range of
 * integer values. It is useful when you want to restrict user input
 * to some value within a range of integers. The range is represented
 * in the gui by a slider with minimum and maximum values and a text
 * box into which you can type some specific value. If the value you
 * enter is greater than the maximum allowable value or less than the
 * minimum value the actual value will be set to the maximum or
 * minimum respectively. Similarly, if you enter a non-numerical value
 * into the text box the value will default to the most recent valid
 * value. Selecting an integer from within the range either via the
 * slider or the text box calls the appropriate set method in your
 * model.<p/>
 * 
 * This class's widget is a RangeWidget.
