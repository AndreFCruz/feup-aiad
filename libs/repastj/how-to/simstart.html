      <p>
         Repast Simulations can be loaded and run either through the Repast
         toolbar or through the command line as a typical Java application.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         Loading and Running a Simulation through the Repast Toolbar
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
         To run a simulation via the Repast toolbar, you first need to start
         Repast. You can do this in a variety of ways. On Windows system, you
         should be able to double click on the repast.jar file in the
         repast\lib directory. Alternatively, the installation process may have
         created a link on the start menu. Regardeless, Repast can always be
         started from the command line in whatever OS (Windows, Unix, Linux, or
         MacOS X) that you use. For example, the following
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -jar c:\repast\lib\repast.jar</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         will start Repast on windows assuming Repast is installed in c:\. On
         Linux and other OSs replace c:\ with wherever Repast has been
         installed. When Repast starts you will see
      </p>
      <p>
         <img alt="error-file:tidyout.log" src="./images/toolbar.png">
      </p>
      <p>
         Clicking on the folder button will display a dialog for loading a
         simulation model into Repast.
      </p>
      <p>
         <img alt="error-file:tidyout.log" src="./images/loadmodel.png">
      </p>
      <p>
         The tree on the left side of the dialog contains all the demonstration
         models that are distributed with Repast together with any simulation
         models that are contained in the repast\models directory. To load a
         model into Repast click on the appropriate node in the tree and then
         on the load button.
      </p>
      <p>
         To add new models to the tree so that you can load them, click on the
         add button. You can then use the file dialog to find the jar or .class
         file that you want to load. In addition you can also add jar or class
         files to the repast/models directory. Note that in order for a .class
         file to be properly loaded it must be in the directory appropriate to
         its package. For example, if we wanted to add
         uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel class (the heat bugs demo
         model) to the tree, HeatBugsModel.class must be in the
         uchicago\src\sim\heatBugs directory. This requirement applies to
         .class files added to the models directory and via the add button. If
         you have a parameter file that you want to load with a model, you can
         enter its location in the parameter file text box or seach for it
         using the &quot;...&quot; button. Once the model has been loaded, it
         can be run via the toolbar. See <a href="interact.html">How to use the
         Gui</a> for more information about using the gui.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         Running a Simulation via the Command Line
      </h3>
      <p>
         Repast simulations can also be run from the command line as a typical
         java application, starting the Java virtual machine with the
         fully-qualified name of the so-called &quot;main&quot; class as an
         argument (a class containing the public static void main(String[]
         args) method). In Repast, this &quot;main&quot; class is either <a
         href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimInit.html">SimInit</a>, and
         its fully qualified name is uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit. or if you
         have defined public static void main(String[] args) in your model
         class, then your model class will be your &quot;main&quot; class. For
         more on making your model the main executable class, see the <a href=
         "./faq.html#main_model">FAQ</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to run Repast, regardeless of the &quot;main&quot; class, the
         Java virtual machine needs to know the location of the core Repast
         library - repast.jar. (Repast uses many other libraries as well but
         repast.jar itself knows how to find these.) The repast.jar is in the
         the repast\lib directory of the repast distribution. You tell the Java
         virtual machine where any required library is located by the including
         it in the classpath. So when starting a Repast simulation you include
         the repast.jar in the classpath in the standard java manner by using
         the -cp switch. For example, Repast can be started from the command
         line as follows (all on one line):
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -jar c:\repast\lib\repast.jar</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         This assumes a windows machine and that repast is installed in c:\.
         Note that I&#39;ve used &quot;\&quot; here as separators. On windows
         you could also use &quot;/&quot;. On Unix the &quot;;&quot; would be
         replaced by &quot;:&quot;, and &#39;c:/repast&#39; with wherever
         repast was installed (e.g. /usr/local/repast).
      </p>
      <p>
         Repast loads models from the command line via the SimInit class, and
         you pass the name of a class as an argument. While this sounds
         complicated the actual command has the generic form of:
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -cp path_to_your_model;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit fullyQualifiedModelName</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         For example to run the Heat Bugs example, the command (all on one
         line) is as follows
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -cp c:/repast/demo/bugs/bugs.jar;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         If your model is in a jar file (as in example above), the path to your
         model should be the path to this jar file. If your model is not in a
         jar file, then you must provide the path to the directory in which you
         model resides. If your model is part of package, as it should be, this
         directory will be the top directory of your package. This is standard
         Java behavior and more details can be found in any good Java book.
         Note that you can also make your jar files themselves executable so
         that your model can be run as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
java -jar my_model.jar.
</pre>
      <p>
         See the <a href="./faq.html#run_jar">FAQ</a> for more information on
         how to make your jar files executable..
      </p>
      <p>
         You can also specify an optional parameter file that will set the
         default parameters for your model. The path to the parameter file
         should follow the fully qualified name of your model. For example (all
         on one line):
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -cp c:/repast/demo/bugs/bugs.jar;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit
uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel c:\params\bugs.pf</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         where bugs.pf is the parameter file name. See <a href=
         "./params.html">How to use Parameters and Parameter Files</a> for more
         on using parameters and parameter files.
      </p>
      <p>
         A simulation can also be run in batch mode free of user intervention
         by specifying the &quot;-b&quot; switch after SimInit and with a
         <b>required</b> parameter file as the final argument. The generic
         command has the form
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -cp path_to_your_model;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit -b fullyQualifiedBatchModelName
parameter_file</b>
</pre>
      <br>
      <br>
<pre>
<b>java -cp c:/repast/demo/bugs/bugs.jar;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsBatchModel
heatBugsParameters.txt</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         You can also specify a number in place of the parameter file,
         specifying how many batch runs you wish to perform. Note that this in
         this case, any parameter manipulation is all done within the model
         itself.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
<pre>
<b>java -cp path_to_your_model;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit -b fullyQualifiedBatchModelName
number &gt; 0</b>
</pre>
      <br>
      <br>
<pre>
<b>java -cp c:/repast/demo/bugs/bugs.jar;c:/repast/lib/repast.jar
uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsBatchModel
3</b>
</pre>
      <p>
         Note that if do not specify a parameter file or a number, a single
         batch run will be executed.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you start Repast via SimInit and do not specify a model, Repast
         will run in gui mode without a model loaded. You can then load a model
         by clicking on the folder icon on the Repast toolbar. A dialog box
         will then be displayed prompting you for your model&#39;s classpath
         and the fully qualified name of your model.
      </p>
      <p>
         SimInit also accepts two additional switches:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            -ng indicates that this is a gui model that you wish to run without
            the gui Controller. SimInit will start your model for you, but it
            is up to the model to stop itself. This switch is generally not
            useful except for automated testing.
         </li>
         <li>
            -v displays the current version number and then exits.
         </li>
      </ul>
