         The API documentation for the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">Schedule</a> and <a
         href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ScheduleBase.html">ScheduleBase</a>
         classes is the source for details about the Schedule object and should
         be used in conjunction with this document and the demonstration source
         code.
      </p>
      <p>
         As with the <a href="http://www.swarm.org">Swarm</a> toolkit the
         Schedule object is responsible for all the state changes within a
         Repast simulation. Consequently, any changes you want to occur in a
         simulation must be scheduled with a Schedule object.
      </p>
      <h3>
         What is Scheduled
      </h3>
      <p>
         At its heart scheduling consists of setting up method calls on objects
         to occur at certain times. However, these method calls must be wrapped
         by sub-classes of the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/BasicAction.html">BasicAction</a>
         class. A BasicAction consists of some variables used by the Scheduler
         and an abstract <tt>public void execute() method</tt>. Any classes
         that sub-class a BasicAction must implement this method. It is in this
         method that the actual method call or calls to be scheduled should
         occur. You can write a sub-class of BasicAction yourself, or have
         Repast create one for you.
      </p>
      <p>
         So, for example, if what you want to schedule is the method call
         step() on an Agent object called agent, you can either write a class
         that sub-classes BasicAction and calls agent.step() in its execute()
         method, or you can have Repast create the BasicAction for you. In the
         former case, your class would look like:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>class MyAction extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    agent.step();
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         It is this execute method that is called by the Scheduler at the
         scheduled time. Creating a schedule then consists of creating
         BasicAction(s) and scheduling these BasicAction(s) for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you wish Repast to create BasicActions for you, this is done
         through through method calls to the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">Schedule</a> object
         itself. Creating BasicActions through a Schedule object allows you to
         schedule and create BasicAction with one method call. As of Repast
         v.1.3, executing these schedule-created BasicActions is no slower than
         executing the hand-created ones. The tradeoff in using the
         schedule-created BasicActions is that it omits typical compiler
         checks. However any errors will be caught when your model run. So for
         example, if you wish to schedule a step() method, and you write your
         own BasicAction subclass, but mispell step() as stwp(). The compiler
         will catch this error, before you run your model. If you allow the
         schedule object to create the BasicAction the spelling error will not
         be caught until you actually run your model. Regardeless of how you
         create your BasicActions, the source code to the demonstration
         simulations use both methods and are good examples of them.
      </p>
      <p>
         Hand coding a class that sub-classes a BasicAction is typically done
         as an inner class<a href="#minar">[1]</a> inside your model class
         itself (see inner classes in the Java <a href=
         "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/more/nested.html">tutorial</a>
         or any decent Java book for more on inner classes). For example, the
         HeatBugsModel.java <tt>buildSchedule()</tt> method could be coded as
         follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>private void buildSchedule() {
    
    class HeatBugsRunner extends BasicAction {
      public void execute() {
        space.diffuse();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; heatBugList.size(); i++) {
          HeatBug bug = (HeatBug)heatBugList.get(i);
          bug.step();
        }
 space.update();
 dsurf.updateDisplay();
      }
    };

    class SnapshotRunner extends BasicAction {
      public void execute() {
        dsurf.takeSnapshot();
      }
    };

    HeatBugsRunner run = new HeatBugsRunner();
    schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, run);

    schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(100, new SnapshotRunner(),
                                      Schedule.LAST);
  }
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here we have two inner classes HeatBugsRunner and SnapshotRunner both
         of which extend (sub-class) BasicAction. In both cases the <tt>public
         void execute()</tt> method executes the appropriate calls. Actually
         scheduling these for execution is then simply a matter of
         instantiating the BasicActions (HeatBugsRunner and SnapshotRunner) and
         scheduling these instantiated classes for execution. The last two
         lines above (the calls to schedule.scheduleActionBeginning and
         schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval) do precisely that. (More on this
         below). All this could also be done with anonymous inner classes with
         perhaps some reduction in clarity. The <tt>schedule</tt> mentioned
         here, on which the two BasicAction classes are scheduled for
         execution, is a <tt>Schedule</tt> object created in the model&#39;s
         <tt>setup()</tt> method. The Schedule.LAST argument will be explained
         below.
      </p>
      <p>
         If the schedule itself created the BasicActions the above could be
         written as:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public void step() {
  space.diffuse();
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; heatBugList.size(); i++) {
    HeatBug bug = (HeatBug)heatBugList.get(i);
    bug.step();
  }
  space.update();
  dsurf.updateDisplay();
}

private void buildSchedule() {
    
    schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, this, &quot;step&quot;);
    schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(100, dsurf, &quot;takeSnapshot&quot;, 
                                      Schedule.LAST);
  }
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The first line in buildSchedule() schedules the step method of this,
         where the &quot;this&quot; keyword refers to the current object, in
         this case, the model, to execute every tick starting at tick 1 (more
         on ticks below). If you need to execute several method calls in a
         specific order as in the step() method above, or in the HeatBugsRunner
         class futher above, its convenient to put them all in a single method,
         rather than schedule each one individually.
      </p>

      <h3>
         How to Schedule BasicActions
      </h3>
      <p>
         Scheduling BasicActions for execution is done via the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">Schedule</a> object. It
         allows you to schedule actions to occur every tick beginning at some
         specified tick, once at some specified tick, at intervals, at a pause
         in the simulation, and at the end of the simulation. (A tick is a
         single iteration over all the BasicActions scheduled for execution at
         that time.) Its important to realize that ticks are only a way to
         schedule actions relative to each other and not discrete entities
         themselves. Actions scheduled for tick 3 will complete execution
         before actions scheduled for tick 10 begin execution. But if noting is
         scheduled for the ticks between 3 and 10, the actions scheduled for 10
         will begin execution immediately after those at tick 3 complete. In
         this way, ticks 4 - 9 do not exist. Ticks maybe fractional values as
         well. For example, it is possible to schedule an action for execution
         at tick 1.25.
      </p>
      <p>
         As for what to schedule, a so-called &quot;step&quot; method for each
         agent, the updateDisplay method for a DisplaySurface are typically
         scheduled for every tick. The above example schedules the execution of
         HeatBugsRunner&#39;s <tt>public void execute()</tt> method to occur at
         every tick beginning at 1, and schedules the execution of
         SnapshotRunner&#39;s <tt>public void execute()</tt> method every 100
         ticks.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can ensure that certain BasicActions occur after other scheduled
         BasicActions by using the Schedule.LAST argument when scheduling
         BasicAction for execution. This argument is accepted by the
         <tt>schedule.scheduleActionAt, schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval</tt>
         methods. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(100, dsurf, &quot;takeSnapshot&quot;, Schedule.LAST);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         schedules a the execution of the takeSnapshot method for every 100
         ticks and ensures that it executes after any other actions not
         scheduled with the Schedule.LAST argument. This is particularly
         useful, and was in fact designed so that things such as data
         collection, snapshot and movie frame creation can be scheduled to
         occur after the BasicActions that would alter the source of the data,
         or images.
      </p>
      <p>
         BasicActions not scheduled using the Schedule.LAST argument will be
         executed in <b>random order</b> and before any BasicActions scheduled
         with Schedule.LAST. If you wish to schedule these non-Schedule.LAST
         BasicActions in sequential order you can collapse your BasicActions
         into each other by enclosing them all in a single method or create an
         <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ActionGroup.html">ActionGroup</a> of
         the sequential type and add your BasicActions to this ActionGroup.
         This ActionGroup should then be scheduled via a schedule object. Some
         examples,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>class Runner2 extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
};

schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, obj1, &quot;doSomething&quot;);
schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, new Runner2());
schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(3, obj3, &quot;takePicture&quot;);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here all three BasicActions will be executed in random order during
         the tick at which they execute. So assuming that doSomething() prints
         out &quot;doSomething&quot;, likewise doSomethingElse() and
         takePicture(), the output over six iterations might look something
         like:
      </p>
<pre>
<tt>tick1: doSomething, doSomethingElse
tick2: doSomethingElse, doSomething
tick3: takePicture, doSomethingElse, doSomething
tick4: doSomethingElse, doSomething
tick5: doSomething, doSomethingElse
tick6: doSomethingElse, takePicture, doSomething
</tt>
</pre>
      <p>
         If we change
      </p>
      <p>
         <tt>schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(3, obj3,
         &quot;takePicture&quot;);</tt>
      </p>
      <p>
         to
      </p>
      <p>
         <tt>schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(3, obj3,
         &quot;takePicture&quot;, Schedule.LAST);</tt>
      </p>
      <p>
         Then &quot;takePicture&quot; would occur last in tick3 and tick6.
      </p>
      <p>
         To get doSomething() and doSomethingElse() to execute in an ordered
         sequence we can do either of the following: call the two method calls
         in another method
      </p>
<pre>
<code> public void doIt() {
    doSomething();
    doSomethingElse();
}

where doIt is a method in the object obj1.

class Runner3 extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    takePicture();
  }
};

schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, obj1, doIt);
schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(3, new Runner3());
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         or we could create a sequential ActionGroup and add both Runner1 and
         Runner2 to it, and the schedule that ActionGroup for execution.
      </p>
<pre>
<code>class Runner1 extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    doSomething();
  }
};

class Runner2 extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
};

class Runner3 extends BasicAction {
  public void execute() {
    takePicture();
  }
};

ActionGroup group = new ActionGroup(ActionGroup.SEQUENTIAL);
group.addAction(new Runner1());
group.addAction(new Runner2());

schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(1, group);
schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(3, new Runner3());
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The BasicActions (Runner1 and Runner2) will be executed in the order
         they are added to the ActionGroup. Note that we could also use the
         createAction* methods of ActionGroup to create and add the
         BasicActions in a single step.
      </p>
      <p>
         The schedule mechanism also provides for the execution of true
         threaded background actions. To create such an action, some
         BasicAction is scheduled for execution just as before with the
         addition of a parameter for defining the duration of such an action.
         The duration specifies how long such an action should execute in the
         background. For example, if action A is scheduled for execution at
         tick 3 with a duration of 4, it will start executing at 3 and then
         continue executing while any other actions scheduled for the
         intervening four ticks are executed. Once 4 ticks have passed, the
         execution engine will wait until this action A has finished executing.
         Its important to note here that action is A is not repeatedly executed
         here in the intervening ticks. Rather, the execution mechanism calls
         action A&#39;s execute method and then rather than waiting for it to
         finish as it normally would, it immediately executes the next
         scheduled action while A&#39;s execute method continues to execute in
         the background. Only when an amount of ticks equal to the duration has
         passed, will the execution mechanism stop and wait for action A to
         finish.
      </p>
      <p>
         An example of scheduling a BasicAction with a duration:
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
<pre>
<code>schedule.scheduleActionAt(3, new LongRunningAction(), 4);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here this new LongRunningAction() is some user-defined BasicAction
         that presumeablely takes a long time to finish execution and is not
         dependent on the results of other actions. This action will be
         executed at tick 3 and continue execution in the background until tick
         7 (3 + 4) at which point the execution mechanism will wait for it to
         finish.
      </p>
      <p>
         Its worth noting here that programming with threads (which is what you
         are doing if you use actions with duration) is tricky. The action
         should be some quasi-independent computationally expensive process
         that does not interfere with the rest of your model.. At the very
         least, it should itself not update the display or anything visualized
         by the display, at least not until it is finished. The use of such
         threaded actions will be easier in a batch environment, but with
         sufficient care it should be possible to use them in a gui environment
         as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         It is also possible to remove BasicActions from Schedules and
         ActionGroups. See the API <a href=
         "../api/index.html">documentation</a> for these objects for more
         information on scheduling.
