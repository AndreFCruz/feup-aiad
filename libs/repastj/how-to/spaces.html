         Spaces Overview

      <p>
         Spaces in Repast serve two purposes. They can be the basis for
         &quot;spatial agents&quot; such as the SugarSpace or the
         InfiniteLifeSpace in the SugarScape and Life demonstration models. And
         they also function as a collection of agents that define the spatial
         relationship of agents relative to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
         Repast offers the following spaces. See the API docs (click the links)
         for more information. Note that Network spaces are quite different and
         are covered in the <a href="./network.html">Network Models</a>
         document.

         These spaces contain methods for inserting and removing items via the
         applicable coordinates. They also contain methods for retrieving a
         list of items in neighboring cells (Von Neumann or Moore neighborhood
         in the case of non-hexagonal spaces and neighborhood &quot;rings&quot;
         for hexagonal) as well as for determining the minimum or maximum item
         in such a neighborhood. What constitutes minimum and maximum can be
         user-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using a space as a spatial collection of agents is fairly simple and
         is typically a matter of inserting and removing agents from the space,
         and perhaps querying the space for an agent&#39;s neighbors. The
         typical pattern is that all agents in a particular space have an
         instance variable reference to that space. So for example, in the
         buildModel method in your model, you&#39;d have something like:
         <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Object2DGrid space = new Object2DGrid(spaceWidth, spaceHeight);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numAgents; i++) {
  int x, y;
  do {
    x = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, space.getSizeX() - 1);
    y = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, space.getSizeY() - 1);
  } while (space.getObjectAt(x, y) != null);

  MyAgent agent = new MyAgent(x, y, space);
  space.putObjectAt(x, y, agent);
  agentList.add(agent);
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The first line here creates an Object2DGrid space. It then creates
         some number of agents of MyAgent type. The do loop gets random x and y
         coordinates and keeps getting new coordinates if the cell in the space
         at those coordinates is full. The agent is then created, given those
         coordinates and a reference to the space, and added to the space at
         those coordinates. (Note that if you were using one of the Multi
         spaces, you wouldn&#39;t need to check if the space cell was occupied
         as more than one agent can occupy a cell in those spaces.)
      </p>
      <p>
         Regardless of what sort of space you use, this pattern is typical. The
         agent has a reference to the space, and knows its own x and y
         coordinates and the space contains the agent. Agent movement is a
         matter of changing the agent&#39;s internal x and y coordinates,
         removing it from its previously occupied cell and adding it to the new
         one. For example, <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>space.putObjectAt(x, y, null);
x = newX;
y = newY;
space.putObjectAt(x, y, this);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         As we see here removing an agent from a space cell is accomplished by
         setting that cell&#39;s occupant to null. This code takes place within
         the agent and thus we use the &quot;this&quot; reference to the
         current agent to place that agent in the new cell. newX and newY have
         been set outside our code snippet and no check that the new cell is
         occupied is done here. Note that the pattern (set to null for remove
         etc.) for working with Multi spaces is the space, although the exact
         methods will be different. See the API docs for details.
