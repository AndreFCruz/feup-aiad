            How to Create Custom Actions
         </h1>
      </center>
      <p>
         Custom actions are actions that occur in response to the movement of a
         slider, the click of a button or the toggling of a checkbox on the
         Custom Action tab in the settings windows. This document explains how
         to create such actions and should be used in conjunction with the
         demonstration source code to the Heat Bugs model, and the Hypercycles
         model.
      </p>
      <p>
         The creation of custom actions is coordinated by the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ModelManipulator.html">Model
         Manipulator</a> class. SimModelImpl contains a ModelManipulator as a
         protected instance variable, and it is thus available to all classes
         that extend SimModelImpl (that is, all Repast models).
         ModelManipulator contains three methods for creating custom actions:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public void addSlider(String label, int min, int max, int tickInterval, 
       SliderListener listener)
public void addButton(String label, ActionListener listener)
public void addCheckBox(String label, CheckBoxListener listener, boolean isSelected)
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         If you want to add a slider, you use addSlider, a button, addButton,
         and a checkbox, addCheckBox. The arguments to these three methods are
         defined in greater detail in the API documentation for <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ModelManipulator.html">Model
         Manipulator</a>. In all these cases however, the listener argument
         specifies what action should be taken when the slider is moved, the
         button is clicked, or the checkbox is toggled. These listener classes
         are abstract classes (SliderListener, CheckBoxListener) or interfaces
         (ActionListener) that are extended or implemented by the modeler to
         perform the appropriate action.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>
         Slider Listener
      </h3>
      <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/event/SliderListener.html">Slider
      Listener</a>
      <p>
         is an abstract class that a user will extend to specify the
         appropriate action to take when the slider is moved. A modeler must
         implement a SliderListener&#39;s <tt>public void execute()</tt>
         method. This method is called whenever the slider is moved. There are
         three variables that are available from within this method:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>value</b> an <tt>int</tt> which is the current value of the
            slider
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>isAdjusting</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> which indicates whether the
            slider is in the process of being moved
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>isSlidingLeft</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> which indicates whether the
            slider is being dragged to the left
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         . A Slider is then created as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>class Incrementer extends SliderListener {
  public void execute() {
    if (isSlidingLeft) {
      someValue -= value;
    } else {
      someValue += value;
    }
  }
};

modelManipulator.addSlider(&quot;Increment&quot;, 0, 100, 10, new Incrementer());
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         (This could also be done more concisely as a anonymous inner class.)
         Here a new class Incrementer that extends SliderListener is defined.
         Its execute method will subtract the current value of the slider from
         <tt>someValue</tt> if the slider is moving left, or add the current
         value of the slider to <tt>someValue</tt> if the slider is moving
         right. The <tt>modelManipulator.addSlider</tt> method associates this
         behavoir with a slider. The slider will be labeled
         &quot;Increment&quot; and range for 0 to 100 with labeled ticks every
         10 units.
      </p>

      <h3>
         ActionListener
      </h3>
      <p>
         The <a href=
         "http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionListener.html">
         ActionListener</a> interface is provided as part Java itself. It has a
         single method: <tt>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)</tt>
         and is used in much the same way as the SliderListener. The modeler
         must provide an implementation of an ActionListener, implementing the
         <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method. Whenever the button is clicked the
         actionPerformed method will be called, and so it is in this method
         that the modeler should code the appropriate actions. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>modelManipulator.addButton(&quot;Clear Space&quot;, new ActionListener() {
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
    space.clear();
  }
});
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         (Here the ActionListener is coded as an anonymous inner class.) The
         ModelManipulator creates a button labeled &quot;Clear Space&quot; and
         the actionPerformed method will be executed whenever that button is
         clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         CheckBoxListener
      </h3>
      <a href=
      "../api/uchicago/src/sim/event/CheckBoxListener.html">CheckBoxListener</a>
      <p>
         is an abstract class that a user will extend to specify the
         appropriate action to take when a checkbox is clicked. Like the
         SliderListener, a modeler must extend this class and implement its
         <tt>public void execute()</tt> method. This method is called whenever
         the checkbox is clicked. Two variables are available from within this
         method:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>isSelected</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> indicating whether the
            checkbox is selected or not
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>actionEvent</b> an <tt>ActionEvent</tt> which should not be of
            interest to most users. See the <a href=
            "http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionEvent.html">
            ActionEvent</a> entry in the jdk javadocs for more on ActionEvents.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         A checkbox is then created as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>CheckBoxListener showVal = new CheckBoxListener() {
  public void execute() {
    if (isSelected) {
      showValues();
    } else {
      hideValues();
    }
  }
};

modelManipulator.addCheckBox(&quot;Show Values&quot;, showVal, false);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here when the checkbox is clicked the execute method will be called.
         This method then checks whether the checkbox is selected through the
         isSelected variable and calls showValues() or hideValues().
         ModelManipulator then creates a checkbox labeled &quot;Show
         Values&quot;, associates it with the <tt>showVal</tt> CheckBoxListener
         and sets its initial state to unselected.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         The Model Manipulator
      </h3>
      <p>
         As mentioned above all models that extend SimModelImpl have acces to a
         ModelManipulator variable called modelManipulator. If you wish to have
         custom actions in your own simulations, you can use this
         modelManipulator. The easiest way to setup a model that will create
         and show the sliders etc. created via a ModelManipulator is to put all
         the slider etc. creation in a private method in your model, and call
         this method as part of your model&#39;s setup() method. <b>Note that
         the first thing you want to call in this method is
         <tt>modelManipulator.init()</tt></b> The Heat Bugs and HyperCycles
         demonstration simulations both setup their custom actions in this way,
         and can be used as templates for your own custom action setup.
