         This document describes how to build a Repast model using the
         SimpleModel class. It is intended as an introduction to writing
         agent-based models with Repast. If you have some experience writing
         agent-based models, you may want to see <a href="./model.html">How to
         Build a Repast Model - 2</a> as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note: the demonstration model &quot;Life&quot; in repast/demo/life is
         an example of how to build a Repast model using the SimpleModel class.

      <p>
         <a name="overview"><b>Overview</b><br>
          An agent-based simulation typically proceeds in two stages. The first
         is a setup stage that prepares the simulation for running, and the
         second is the actual running of the simulation. In Repast simulations
         the running of the simulation is divided into time steps or
         &quot;ticks.&quot; Each tick some action occurs using the results of
         previous actions as its basis. So, for example, if we were building a
         prisoner&#39;s dilemma type simulation with two players, setup would
         create the two players, and provide each with an initial strategy
         (tit-for-tat, etc.). Each tick or time step, each player would play
         the game (cooperate or defect) where their current play is dependent
         on their strategy and perhaps on the results of previous play. What
         you need to do then to build a simple Repast model is describe what
         happens during setup, and what occurs every tick. The SimpleModel
         class provides placeholders for you to do this.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="simplemodel"><b>SimpleModel</b><br>
          Repast simulations typically have at least two classes. An agent
         class that describes the behavior of your agents (e.g. play a game by
         cooperating or defecting) and a model class that coordinates the setup
         and running of the model. You use SimpleModel as the basis of your
         model class, specializing it to suit your purposes. In Java such
         specialization is typically done via inheritance such that SimpleModel
         becomes the super-class of your model class. For example,
         <code></code></a>
      </p>
<pre>
import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class MyModel extends SimpleModel {

...

}
</pre>
      <p>
         In the first line we import SimpleModel and in the next we extend
         SimpleModel with our own model class.
      </p>
      <p>
         In writing our simulation, as mentioned above, we want to describe how
         to setup our model, and then describe what happens every time step.
         SimpleModel provides methods that we override in our own model to do
         the setup specific to our model. These two methods are setup() and
         buildModel(). We use them as follows: <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code><font color="gray">import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class MyModel extends SimpleModel {
</font>

  public static

  final int TIT_FOR_TAT = 0; public static
  final int ALWAYS_DEFECT = 1; private int

  p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT; private
  int p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;

  ...

  public void setup() {
    super.setup();
    p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT;
    p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;
  }

  public void buildModel() {
    Player p1 = new Player(p1Strategy);
    Player p2 = new Player(p2Strategy);
    p1.setOtherPlayer(p2);
    p2.setOtherPlayer(p1);
    agentList.add(p1);
    agentList.add(p2);
  }
}

</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here we use setup() and buildModel() to specialize SimpleModel for our
         own purposes. In setup() we first call super.setup() to insure that
         SimpleModel does any necessary setup of its own, and then we set the
         player strategies. The assumption here is that the strategies may have
         changed from their default values either through user interaction or
         perhaps during the course of a previous simulation run. We use setup()
         as the opportunity to set our model variables back to some reasonable
         default. In general, setup() should &quot;tear down&quot; the model in
         preparation for the next run. setup() is called when the simulation is
         first started, and more frequently, whenever the setup button is
         clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
         Where setup() &quot;tears downs&quot; the simulation, we use
         buildModel() to create the objects that our simulation uses. So, it is
         here where your agents should be created, and added to the master list
         of agents, agentList. agentList is an ArrayList provided by
         SimpleModel for this purpose. The assumption here is that our Player
         class is constructed with a reference to the initial strategy and a
         reference to the other Player to play.
      </p>
      <p>
         The order of execution is that setup() is called first and then
         buildModel(). However, as mentioned above, setup() is called when the
         simulation is first started, and whenever the setup button is pressed.
         buildModel() is not called until the simulation is run, that is, it is
         not called until either the run, step or initialize buttons are
         pressed. (See below for more on what code is executed by what
         buttons.) This provides an opportunity for the user to change any
         parameters via the gui.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now that setup is finished, we need to define what occurs each
         timestep of the simulation. SimpleModel provides three methods for
         this. They are preStep(), step() and postStep(). Each tick they are
         executed in that order, first preStep(), then step(), and lastly
         postStep(). The intention here is to separate the core behavior in
         step() from any necessary pre- or post- processing. In our example, we
         have no such need for any pre- or post- processing, so we only use the
         step() method. <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code><font color="gray">import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class

MyModel extends SimpleModel { public static

  final int TIT_FOR_TAT = 0; public static
  final int ALWAYS_DEFECT = 1; private int

  p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT; private
  int p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;

  ...

  public void setup() {
    super.setup();
    p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT;
    p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;
  }

  public void buildModel() {
    Player p1 = new Player(p1Strategy);
    Player p2 = new Player(p2Strategy);
    p1.setOtherPlayer(p2);
    p2.setOtherPlayer(p1);
    agentList.add(p1);
    agentList.add(p2);
  }
</font>
  public void step() {
    int size = agentList.size();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      Player p = (Player)agentList.get(i);
      p.play();
    }
  }
}

</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here in the step() method we pull each Player out of our master
         agentList and call the play() method on each one. The assumption here
         is that a Player plays another Player when we call play(). It is
         typical in the step() method to iterate through all your agents and
         call whatever method executes their behavoir on each one. When the
         model runs it is this step() method that will execute each time step.
      </p>
      <p>
         A different game might require a pre- or postStep() method. For
         example, assume something like a cooperation game with many players
         where after each player has played its neighbors and received a
         payoff, each player then polls its neighborhood for the best strategy,
         and sets its own strategy accordingly. In this case, the actual play
         would be defined as above in the step method, and the neighborhood
         polling and strategy setting would occur in a postStep() method.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is an alternative to using step() in your model. You can use the
         auto step mechanism. If you choose do this, SimpleModel will iterate
         through all your agents and call the step method defined in your
         agents. In order for this to work, your agents must implement the
         Stepable interface. This interface has a single method, step(). Note
         that step() here is a method in your agent class <b>not</b> your model
         class. This autostep takes the place of your model&#39;s step method
         described above. To use the auto step mechanism, you set the autoStep
         instance variable to true in the constructor of your model. You can
         also set the shuffle instance variable to true or false depending on
         whether you wish to shuffle the agentList before auto-stepping through
         it. preStep() and postStep() work as above, being called before and
         after the autoStep, respectively. Regardeless of whether we use
         preStep(), postStep(), both, or auto step, this is all that is
         required to create a simulation with SimpleModel: fill in setup(),
         buildModel() and step() (or auto step), as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that much more complicated scheduling of agent behavior, model
         events, etc, including dynamic scheduling, is possible with Repast.
         SimpleModel is intended to simplify scheduling and the discussion
         above reflects this. However, you do have access to the scheduler from
         within a SimpleModel model via the schedule instance variable. See <a
         href="./scheduler.html">How to Use a Schedule</a> for more information
         on scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
         The relationship between the various tool bar buttons and the actual
         execution of code is as follows. When the setup button is clicked, the
         code in the setup() method is executed. When the initialize button is
         clicked, the code in buildModel() is executed. When the step button is
         clicked, the code in buildModel() is executed and the preStep(),
         step(), and postStep() sequence is executed once. When the start
         button is clicked, buildModel() is executed, and the preStep(),
         step(), and postStep() sequence is executed repeatedly until the user
         clicks the stop or pause button.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="parameters"><b>Parameters</b><br>
          While setup(), buildModel() and step() are all we need to create a
         simulation, such a simulation is not very interesting. It has &quot;no
         knobs to twiddle&quot;; we can&#39;t alter the initial conditions of
         the model very easily. We can provide such knobs by creating
         parameters for our model.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         A model parameter is defined by accessor methods. These are methods
         that begin with get and set. So, a parameter for player1&#39;s
         strategy might look like <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code><font color="gray">import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class

MyModel extends SimpleModel { public static


  final int TIT_FOR_TAT = 0; public static
  final int ALWAYS_DEFECT = 1; private int

  p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT; private
  int p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;
</font><b>
  public void setP1Strategy(int val) {
    p1Strategy = val;
  }

  public int getP1Strategy() {
    return p1Strategy;
  }

</b>
 <font color="gray"> public void setup() {
    super.setup();
    p1Strategy = TIT_FOR_TAT;
    p2Strategy = ALWAYS_DEFECT;
  }

  public void buildModel() {
    Player p1 = new Player(p1Strategy);
    Player p2 = new Player(p2Strategy);
    p1.setOtherPlayer(p2);
    p2.setOtherPlayer(p1);
    agentList.add(p1);
    agentList.add(p2);
  }

  public void step() {
    int size = agentList.size();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      Player p = (Player)agentList.get(i);
      p.play();
    }
  }
}
</font>
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The parameter name is the accessor method names minus the get / set.
         So, here the parameter name is P1Strategy. The last piece of creating
         a parameter is to make Repast aware of it. You do this by including
         the parameter name in the string array of parameters. This can be done
         in the constructor of your model. For example, <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class MyModel extends SimpleModel {

  ...

  public MyModel() {
    params = new String[] {&quot;P1Strategy&quot;};
  }

  ...

}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The params variable is provided by SimpleModel. It is an array
         containing the names of your parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once you&#39;ve created your parameter accessor methods and placed
         your parameter name in the param array, you will see the parameter
         displayed in the parameter pane when the simulation is run. The value
         of this parameter is whatever is returned by its get accessor method.
         The parameter is set by entering a new value in the parameters text
         box. The change is registed either by pressing enter, or when the text
         box loses focus. This newly entered value then becomes the argument to
         the parameter&#39;s set accessor method. Its important to note here
         that its the accessor methods that are important, the actual variable
         where the parameter is stored (e.g. p1Strategy) is never seen by the
         parameter mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are also ways to display parameters as check boxes, combo boxes,
         buttons, etc. See <a href="./prop.html">How to create
         PropertyDescriptors</a> for more info.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="name"><b>Naming your Model</b><br>
          You can provide a name for your simulation via the name instance
         variable. Assign the appropriate value to this variable in your
         model&#39;s constructor. For example, <code></code></a>
      </p>
<pre>
import uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimpleModel;

public class MyModel extends SimpleModel {

  ...

  public MyModel() {
    name = &quot;Example Model&quot;;
  }

  ...

}
</pre>
      <p>
         This name will then be the title of your model&#39;s toolbar window.

       Displays, data recorders and so forth can be incorporated into
      SimpleModel based models just as they can any other models. See the <a
      href="./how_to.html">How To Index</a> for more information.</a>
      <p>
         The only caveat here is that displays are typically although not
         necessarily created in a buildDisplay method. To incoporate such a
         method into your own code, you can add the method then call it in
         buildModel(). For example, <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code> public class MyModel extends SimpleModel {

  private DisplaySurface dsurf;

  ...

  private void buildDisplay() {
    ...
  }

  public void buildModel() {
    ...
    buildDisplay();
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         You can then put your display building code in buildDisplay() and be
         sure that it will be called when your model begins a run.
         Alternatively, you can put all the code into buildModel(), but
         separating out the display building code is somewhat cleaner.
