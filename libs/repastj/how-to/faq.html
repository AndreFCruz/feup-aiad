               How do I make my model the &quot;main&quot; executable class?

            Executable classes in java, that is classes that can be run from
            the command line with <code>java MyClass.class</code> to start an
            application, must implement the main method. The main method has
            the following signature <code>public static void main(String[]
            args)</code>. If you wish your model to be executable then you need
            to implement this method in your code. The method itself will look
            something like: 
<pre>
<code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    SimInit init = new SimInit();
    HeatBugsModel model = new HeatBugsModel();
    init.loadModel(model, null, false);      
  }
</code>  
</pre>
            This code creates an instance of the SimInit class (the same class
            with which you can load your models on the command line), and
            instance of the model itself. It then uses SimInit to load the
            model via the loadModel method. The second and third parameters of
            the loadModel method specify a parameter file and whether or not
            the model is a batch model. You can either pass values to these
            parameters via the args array or if you know that this model is a
            batch model, you can specify the method parameters directly. The
            following is an example of the later. 
<pre>
<code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    SimInit init = new SimInit();
    EnnBatchModel model = new EnnBatchModel();
    init.loadModel(model, &quot;./EnnParams.txt&quot;, true);      
  }
</code>  
</pre>
            This code snippet is from EnnBatchModel.java in the enn demo (see
            repast/demo/enn). Here we create an instance of SimInit and the
            model as above. We then pass a parameter file path and a value of
            true to the second and third arguments of the loadModel method.
            With these parameters SimInit would load EnnBatchModel in batch
            mode, and read the parameters from the EnnParams.txt file. 
            <p>
               If you wish to parse the arguments in the args parameter of the
               main method and pass them to the loadModel, the following shoudl
               help. For a command line of:
            </p>
<pre>
<code>java -cp c:\repast\lib\repast.jar;. MyModel param.pf true
</code>  
</pre>
            args[0] = param.pf and args[1] = true. And knowing this it should
            not be hard to parse args[] and extract the appropriate values to
            pass to the loadModel method. <a name="run_jar"></a>

            To do this you must create your own manifest file and then use this
            manifest file when you create your jar file. A manifest file is
            simply a plain text file with some special tags that the Java
            virtual machine knows how to work with. You can include special
            tags in the mainfest file that tell the Java virtual machine which
            file in that jar file is the executable &quot;main&quot; class, as
            well as specifying a classpath. As of Repast 1.3 all the
            demonstration simulations are run in this way. The following is the
            manifest file from bugs.jar (the heatbugs demo simulation). 
<pre>
<code>Main-Class: uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel
  Class-Path: ../../lib/repast.jar ../../lib/trove.jar ../../lib/colt.jar 
  ../../lib/jgl3.1.0.jar ../../lib/excelaccessor_Runtime.jar ../../lib/jmf.jar 
  ../../lib/jcchart.jar ../../lib/junit.jar ../../lib/plot.jar 
  ../../lib/xerces.jar
</code>  
</pre>
            The <code>Class-Path:</code>entries should all be one line. Here
            the main class is uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel and it
            requires the specified classpath in order to execute correctly. The
            class path is space delimited here, and the paths of the jar files
            are defined relative to the bugs.jar file. In this case two
            directories above the repast/demo/bugs directory in the repast/lib
            directory. With this manifest file in the bugs.jar archive, we
            execute the heatbugs simulation with <code>java -jar
            bugs.jar</code>. This has the added benefit of making the jar file
            executable when double click under windows. Given the above
            manifest file, this is directly equivalent to: 
<pre>
<code>java -cp  ./bugs.jar;../../lib/repast.jar;../../lib/trove.jar;
  ../../lib/colt.jar; ../../lib/jgl3.1.0.jar;
  ../../lib/excelaccessor_Runtime.jar;../../lib/jmf.jar;
  ../../lib/jcchart.jar;../../lib/junit.jar;../../lib/plot.jar;
  ../../lib/xerces.jar uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel
</code>  
</pre>
            (Note that as of Repast v.1.3, you no longer start models this way.
            repast.jar itself contains a manifest file that specifies a
            classpath containing all the other required jar files. So instead
            of the above, you can do <code>java -cp
            ./bugs.jar;../../lib/repast.jar
            uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel</code>.) 
            <p>
               Once you&#39;ve written your manifest file, you need to include
               it in your jar. If you haven&#39;t yet created your jar file,
               you can do this all in one step with the &#39;jar&#39; utility
               that comes with the java development kit.
            </p>
<pre>
<code>jar cfvm my_model.jar mymanifest my_model_dir
</code>  
</pre>
            where my_model.jar is the name of the jar file you are creating,
            mymanifest is the manifest file you&#39;ve created and my_model_dir
            is the directory for your actual model. So for heatbugs this looks
            like: 
<pre>
<code>jar cfvm bugs.jar bugs_manifest uchicago/src/sim/heatBugs
</code>  
</pre>
            If your model is in a package (as it should be) its important to
            jar it from the directory above the first package directory. In the
            heatbugs case I would run the jar command from the directory in
            which the uchicago directory resided. 
            <p>
               If you already have your classes in a jar file and just want to
               add the manifest file, replace the &#39;c&#39; in the above
               command with a &#39;u&#39;.
            </p>
            <p>
               You can inspect the contents of your jar file with <code>jar -tf
               name_of_jar_file</code>. Your manifest won&#39;t be included in
               the jar itself as its contents are actually copied into the
               MANIFEST.MF file.
            </p>

         <li style="list-style: none">
            As of Repast 1.3, SimModelImpl (and thus all models that inherit
            from it) implements two new methods: <code>public void
            stop()</code>and <code>public void pause</code>. You can call these
            methods from within the model to stop or pause it. Like any other
            public method, this methods are schedulable so you can schedule
            your model to pause (or stop) at particular intervals or at
            specified ticks. For example, 
<pre>
<code>int pauseTick = -1;
  ...
  private void buildSchedule() {
    schedule.scheduleActionAt(pauseTick, this, &quot;pause&quot;, Schedule.LAST);
    ...
  }
  
  public void setPauseTick(int val) {
    pauseTick = val;
    schedule.scheduleActionAt(pauseTick, this, &quot;pause&quot;, Schedule.LAST);
  }
  
  public int getPauseTick() {
    return pauseTick;
  }
</code>  
</pre>
            will allow you to schedule pauses through the gui.

            If your agent implements the <code>CustomProbeable</code>interface

            displayed. For example, 
<pre>

            </h3>
         </li>
         <li style="list-style: none">
            The following code demonstrates how to do this: 
<pre>
<code>public void setup() {
    
    ...
  
    Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
    c.addButton(&quot;Help&quot;, new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
         showHelp();
       }
    });
  
  }
</code>  
</pre>
            Controller has three new methods for adding custom buttons to the
            toolbar. Using the addButton methods you can add a JButton
            directly, specify a label and an ActionListener, or specify the
            path to an Icon and an ActionListener. The above code snippet will
            add new a JButton with the label &quot;Help&quot; to the toolbar
            and call the showHelp method whenever it is clicked. You must add
            new buttons in your model&#39;s setup() method otherwise they will
            not appear in the toolbar. 
            <p>
               If you don&#39;t understand how to work with JButtons, and
               ActionListeners, you should learn a bit about the Java&#39;s
               Swing gui toolkit before adding custom buttons to the toolbar.

         </li>
         <li style="list-style: none">
            You can perform some action in response to key events when either
            the DisplaySurface, or the Controller (i.e. the Repast toolbar) has
            focus. Which one you choose depends on which one is more
            appropriate for your action. For example, if you wish to do
            something to the display in the DisplaySurface, then you&#39;d hook
            the key code up to the DisplaySurface. In either case, the code to
            listen for key events is the same. For example, 
<pre>
<code>Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
  c.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
      if (evt.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_K) {
       System.out.println(&quot;k key typed&quot;);
      }
    }
  });
</code>  
</pre>
            will print &quot;k key typed&quot; to the console whenever the
            toolbar (i.e. the Controller) has focus and the &quot;k&quot; key
            is pressed. To perform the same action when a DisplaySurface has
            focus, you&#39;d replace the reference to the Controller with one
            to your DisplaySurface. So, 
<pre>
<code>myDisplaySurface.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
      if (evt.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_K) {
       System.out.println(&quot;k key typed&quot;);
      }
    }
  });
</code>  
</pre>
            Typically you place this sort code to the setup() method in your
            model. This ensures that you can listener for key events before
            your simluation begins to run. Note that KeyAdapter and KeyEvent
            are in the java.awt.event package, so you&#39;ll have to import
            them into your model. Adding KeyListeners in this way is standard
            Java and any Java book can provide more details.

            By default Repast takes the appropriate action whenever you click
            one of the toolbar buttons. However, you can also add your own to
            code to be executed when a button is clicked. You can listen for
            button clicks on the start, stop, pause, step, and exit buttons.
            For example, 
<pre>
<code>Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
  c.addStartListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
      System.out.println(&quot;start&quot;);
    }
  });
</code>  
</pre>
            This code listens for start button clicks and prints
            &quot;start&quot; to the console whenever a start button click
            occurs. Each button has its own add listener method so
            addStopListener will add code for execution on stop button clicks,
            addPauseListener for pause button clicks and so on. If you wish to
            know which button has been clicked (assuming you&#39;ve got the
            same listener listening to more than one button), the button&#39;s
            actionCommand reports the buttons name. For example, the code 
<pre>
<code>Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
  c.addStartListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
      javax.swing.JButton b = (javax.swing.JButton)evt.getSource();
      System.out.println(b.getActionCommand());
    }
  });
</code>  
</pre>
            will print &quot;start&quot;, the Start button&#39;s action
            command, to the console. The exit button&#39;s action command is
            &quot;exit&quot;, pause is &quot;pause&quot; and so on. Adding
            listeners to buttons in this way is standard Java and any good book
            on Java can tell you more.

            </h3>
            Suppose you have two properties connected with each other such that
            a change to implies a change to other. When you change the first
            such property in a probe panel (either the agent&#39;s probe panel,
            or your model&#39;s parameter panel) you&#39;d like the panel to
            update and display the concommitant change in the second property. 
            <p>
               You can update an Object&#39;s probe panel using
               <tt>ProbeUtilities.updateProbePanel(Object object)</tt> method.
               The object here is the object whose probe panel you wish to
               update. So, for example, we could implement the above scenario
               where a change to parameter X, changed the value of parameter y
               and we want the parameter (probe) window to display the new
               value of y, as follows:
            </p>
<pre>
<code>public void setX(int val) {
    x = val;
    setY(val / 2);
    ProbeUtilities.updateProbePanel(this);
  }
  
  public void setY(int val) {
    y = val;
  }
  
  ...
  
</code>  
</pre>
            This is also useful for turning various exclusive boolean switches
            on and off in response to others being set on.

         </li>
         <li style="list-style: none">
            The context here is that you are running your model in gui mode and
            that you are probing your agents such that their properties are
            displayed in a probe window. You&#39;d like these properties to
            update every tick of the model. This can be done both via the GUI
            and in code. To turn this on via the gui, switch to the Repast
            actions tab panel and click on Update Probes. To do this in code,
            you set the UPDATE_PROBES flag in Controller to true. For example, 
<pre>
<code>Controller.UPDATE_PROBES = true;
</code>  
</pre>
            This will update all probes except for that on the model. To update
            the model probe, you&#39;ll have to call
            <tt>ProbeUtilities.updateModelProbePanel</tt>. Updating the
            model&#39;s probe is computationally expensive. 
            <p>
               Note that updating probes will slow down your model although
               considerably less in java 1.4 vs. previous version of java.

            Stdout (output written to <code>System.out</code>) and stderr
            (errors written to <code>System.err</code>) can be redirected to
            The Repast Console. The Repast Console can be turned on or off via
            the GUI and in code. To turn it on/off via the GUI, switch to the
            Repast actions tab panel and click on &quot;Stdout to Console&quot;
            or &quot;Stderr to Console&quot; to either one on or off. Note that
            if they are both off then the Repast Console will not appear. To do
            this in code, you need to set the flags
            AbstractGUIController.CONSOLE_OUT and

            At this point, there is not explicit support for 3D spaces in
            Repast. However, several people have used 3D graphs/displays and
            spaces on their own. One of the items on our list of things to do
            is to add 3D support, so hopefully it will happen soon. The
            references to z-coords in various classes are there so that, in the
            future, we will be compatible. If anyone has experience with 3D and
