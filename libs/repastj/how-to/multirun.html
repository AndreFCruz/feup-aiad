         This document describes how to use the &quot;Multi-Run&quot;
         capabilities in Repast. This includes the Multi-Run button on the
         Repast toolbar, and the Parameter Wizard.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="overview"></a><b>Overview</b><br>
         Repast has previously included support for performing batch simulation
         runs. This is useful when you want to run a simulation without the
         extra burden of graphical displays or when you have a large set of
         parameters you wish to run your model against (More information on
         this is available in <a href="./params.html">How to Use Parameters and
         Parameter files</a>). New in Repast 3 is the capability to build
         parameter files through a graphical wizard and the ability to execute
         these batch runs from the Repast toolbar.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="wizard"></a><b>The Parameter Wizard</b><br>
         The Parameter wizard automatically searches a model for the parameters
         available. It will load the parameters from the model&#39;s
         getInitParam(). Once they are loaded you can choose how the parameter
         will be fed through into the model. You have the choice of the
         parameter being a single constant value, an incremented value
         (starting at some value, incrementing by another value, and continuing
         until it has hit a final value), or a list of values.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
         You can get to the Parameter wizard in two ways, one by choosing a
         model through the Load Model dialog (available through the Open button
         on the toolbar <img alt="error-file:tidyout.log" src=
         "./images/Open24.gif" align="absMiddle">); the other through the
         Multi-Run button on the toolbar <img alt="Multi-Run button" src=
         "images/ParameterSweep.gif" align="absMiddle">.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="button"></a><b>The Multi-Run Button</b><br>
         The Multi-Run button is used to start a set of batch runs on a model
         through the Repast toolbar.&nbsp; When you have a model loaded you can
         click on the Multi-Run button and you will be prompted to choose a
         parameter file.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <center>
         <img alt="error-file:tidyout.log" src="images/paramBrowse.png">
      </center>
      <p>
         If you do not have a previously generated parameter file, by choosing
         cancel you will be notified that you must choose a parameter file and
         you then will be returned to the now expanded Repast toolbar.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
         Now by clicking on the combo box on the toolbar that currently says
         &quot;&lt;Browse...&gt;&quot; you can either choose to again browse
         for a parameter file or you can choose &quot;&lt;Create...&gt;&quot;
         which will take you to the parameter wizard.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once you have selected (or created) a parameter file, you then can
         execute the model on it by clicking the Multi-Run button.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="runwalkthrough"></a><b>A Multi-Run</b><br>
         Once you have your parameter file selected, you can then click on the
         Multi-Run button. This will start the model in batch mode. The
         &quot;Tick Count&quot; label will update according to the current tick
         of the model and the Run count label will update according to which
         run the model is on (a run is started every time the model stops).<br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="notes"></a><b>Multi-Run Notes</b><br>
         For a run to end the model must in some way end. This can happen
         through a call to super.stop() from inside a SimModel or by calling
         stopSim() on the current controller. Also, the model still must handle
         being in batch mode by itself. This means, if you do not wish for
         displays and graphs and other GUI elements of your model to display,
         you must disable them yourself. A simple way to do this is to have a
         DisplayGUI parameter in your model and whenever that parameter is set
         to something like 0 do not show the displays, otherwise do.
