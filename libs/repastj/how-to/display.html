      Displays, that is graphical presentations of agents and their
      environments, are created in Repast through the use of three types of
      classes: spaces (the classes in the uchicago.src.sim.space package), the
      displays corresponding to those spaces (e.g. Object2DDisplay) in the
      uchicago.src.sim.gui package and a <a href=
      "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DisplaySurface.html">DisplaySurface</a>. In
      addition, those objects such as agents, and individual environment
      objects must implement certain interfaces if they are to be displayed.
      The actual interface to be implemented depends on the type of display.
      The source to the demonstration simulations are good examples of how all
      these fit together and should be explored in conjunction with this
      document.</a>
      <p>
         Before looking at the buildDisplay() method, it is helpful to
         understand how Repast actually sets up and draws displays. Setting up
         Repast for drawing consists of several steps. The first of these is
         creating what you want to be drawn. Usually, these are agents and
         their environment. As mentioned in <a href="./model.html">How To Build
         a Repast Model</a> agents etc. are created in buildModel(). Also in
         buildModel() these agents are added to some sort of space, a
         Object2DTorus for example, and sometimes a list. Then in
         buildDisplay() the display (e.g. Object2DDisplay) appropriate to the
         space is created and the space is added to that display. The list, if
         it exists, is also added to the display. The display itself is then
         added to a DisplaySurface either as a displayable or as a
         displayableProbeable depending on whether probing is to be performed
         on the objects contained by the space in the display. (The
         DisplaySurface itself should be created in the model&#39;s
         <tt>setup()</tt> method. In short then, after buildDisplay() you have
         a DisplaySurface containing displays that contain spaces that contain
         the objects to be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
         With this structure setup then, the actual drawing sequence is as
         follows. The updateDisplay method is called on the DisplaySurface
         object. Typically, this call is scheduled and the scheduling mechanism
         makes the call. Having received this call, the DisplaySurface object
         tells all the displays it contains to display themselves. Having
         received this call, the displays either gets a list of all the objects
         in the space that they contain, or if a list of objects was added,
         they just use that list. The display then requests some drawing
         information (coordinates, etc.) from each object in the list, sets up
         the drawing surface using this information, and then tells each object
         in the list to draw itself. These objects then draw themselves. In
         order for a display to display an object it expects the drawable
         object to implement certain methods. These methods vary slightly
         according to the display and are encapsulated in one or another of the
         drawable interfaces. A mapping of which interfaces to use with which
         spaces and displays is given <a href="#mapping">below</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         As mentioned in <a href="./model.html">How To Build a Repast Model</a>
         the display is usually created in the buildDisplay() method. A very
         simple buildDisplay() might look like:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public void buildDisplay() {
   Object2DDisplay agentDisplay = new Object2DDisplay(world);
   agentDisplay.setObjectList(agentList);

   dsurf.addDisplayableProbeable(agentDisplay, &quot;Agents&quot;);
   addSimEventListener(dsurf);
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         where world is a space, an Object2DTorus populated with agents,
         agentList is a simple list of agents, and dsurf is a DisplaySurface,
         all having been created previously in buildModel() or in the case of
         dsurf in setup(). Here the display is created and as part of its
         construction the space &quot;world&quot; added to it. Then agentList
         is also added to it for display. This display, agentDisplay, is then
         added to the DisplaySurface dsurf as both a displayable and a
         probeable. As a displayable dsurf will display agentDisplay in the
         manner outlined above. As a probeable dsurf will allow probing on the
         agents contained in the space, in this case world, contained by
         agentDisplay. The final method adds dsurf to the model as a listener
         for stop and pause events. This allows dsurf to know when the model is
         stopped or paused and behave accordingly. It may seem redundant to add
         both agentList and world to agentDisplay. It is not, however, because
         spaces do more than provide displays with lists of objects to display,
         they also take part in the probing mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="text_display"><b>The Text Display</b><br>
         The <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/TextDisplay.html">TextDisplay</a> differs
         from the other displays in that it does not display a space. Rather,
         it used to display text on the DisplaySurface. You specify what text
         to display and the TextDisplay will display that text.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         Setting up a TextDisplay works as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>td = new TextDisplay(20, 20, Color.yellow);
dsurf.addDisplayableProbeable(td, &quot;text&quot;);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This creates a TextDisplay which will display text at the specified x
         and y coordinates (20, 20) and in yellow. This kind of code would
         typically occur in your buildDisplay() method. &quot;td&quot; here is
         an instance variable of your model class. Note that the coordinates
         refer to pixels and not to grid cell locations. The TextDisplay
         &quot;td&quot; is then added to the DisplaySurface just like any other
         display. By default the text is displayed inside a rectangle of the
         same color as the text. This rectangle can be moved around the display
         using the mouse. You specify the text to display using the
         <code>addLine(String line)</code> method. This adds text without
         removing previously added text. To remove any previously added text,
         you use the <code>clearLines()</code> method. The addition of new text
         is typically done as part of a scheduled action in order that the text
         reflect the new state of the model. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>td.clearLines();
td.addLine(&quot;tick count: &quot; + getTickCount());
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The above would be scheduled to occur every tick, and thus would
         display a new tick count value each tick of the model.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are variations on the <code>addLine</code> and
         <code>clearLines</code> methods as well as methods for turning the
         rectangle on and off. See the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/TextDisplay.html">API</a> docs for more
         info.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="movie"><b>Taking Snapshots and Making Movies</b><br>
         Repast can be used to take snapshots, that is gif images of the
         current display, as well as make quicktime movies using the display as
         it changes over the course of a run. All this functionality is
         available through the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DisplaySurface.html">DisplaySurface</a>
         class. You can either manually setup your simulation to take snapshots
         and create movies, or use the buttons provided in the Repast Action
         tab. What follows is a description of manual setup.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         To setup the display surface for taking shapshots, you would call
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>dsurf.setSnapshotFileName(some_fileName);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         in buildDisplay(). A DisplaySurface will use this name as the base for
         the the actual gif file or files. Then in the buildSchedule() method
         you schedule the DisplaySurface to actually take snapshots of the
         display at the tick of the simulation. For example given a
         DisplaySurface dsurf,
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(100, dsurf,
         &quot;takeSnapshot&quot;);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         dsurf will now create gifs of the display at every 100 ticks of the
         simulation. The resulting gif files will be
         some_fileName_tick_count.gif. For example, heatbugpic100.gif.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can also take snapshots of the Repast charting objects
         (OpenSequenceGraph and OpenHistogram) in a nearly identical way.
         Simply substitute the variable names of your charting objects for
         dsurf in the above.
      </p>
      <p>
         Making movies is similar. To prepare a DisplaySurface for making a
         movie you would call
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>dsurf.setMovieName(movie_name,
         DisplaySurface.QUICK_TIME);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         And to actually turn the display at certain simulation tick into a
         frame of the movie, you need to schedule the addMovieFrame on a
         DisplaySurface.
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>schedule.scheduleActionAtInterval(10, dsurf,
         &quot;addMovieFrame&quot;);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         which will take the display every 10 ticks and make a movie frame from
         it. At the moment only quicktime movies are supported. The resulting
         movie file will be whatever the movie_name was in setMovieName
         combined with the extension appropriate to the type of movie. For
         example, &quot;heatBugMovie.mov&quot;. You must also explicitly send
         the closeMovie message to the DisplaySurface. For example,
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>schedule.scheduleActionAtEnd(dsurf,
         &quot;closeMovie&quot;);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         while will send the closeMovie message at the end of the simulation.
         When the movie has finished writing itself to a file, you will see the
         message box informing you of this. <b>Do not exit the simulation until
         you see and click on the message box.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         Making movies of the Repast chart objects is not supported as this
         time.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Repast action tab can be used to automate taking snapshots and
         making movies of your DisplaySurfaces or charting objects. Clicking on
         the appropriate button on the Repast action tab will present you with
         a self-explanatory series of choices. However, in order for this to
         work, you&#39;ll need to pay some attention to how these objects are
         created in your setup() method. In general you&#39;ll need to create
         these objects in the setup method and register them as DisplaySurfaces
         or MediaProducters. DisplaySurfaces should be registered as
         DisplaySurfaces and the charting objects as MediaProducers. For
         example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>private void setup() {
  ...    
  dsurf = new DisplaySurface(this, &quot;Sugar Scape&quot;);
  registerDisplaySurface(&quot;Sugar Scape&quot;, dsurf);
  bar = new OpenHistogram(&quot;Agent Wealth Distribution&quot;, 10, 0, this); 
  graph = new OpenSequenceGraph(&quot;Agent Attributes&quot;, this, &quot;./graph_data.txt&quot;,
                              Statistics.CSV);


  registerMediaProducer(&quot;Hist&quot;, bar);
  registerMediaProducer(&quot;Plot&quot;, graph);
  ...
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Registering an object or DisplaySurface allows it to be displayed as
         available as a source of snapshots and movies. Clicking the &quot;take
         Snapshot&quot; button in the Repast Actions tab allows you to choose
         from among these registered objects as sources of snapshots. In the
         above case you&#39;d have a choice of one or all of &quot;Sugar
         Scape&quot;, &quot;Hist&quot;, or &quot;Plot&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Note</b>: at this time making movies of charting objects is not
         supported.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="mapping"><b>Drawable, Space and Display Mappings</b><br>
         Use the following table to determine what interface to implement on
         your agents when using a particular space and display. So for example,
         if your agents inhabit an <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/space/Object2DTorus.html">Object2DTorus</a>
         you would use an <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/Object2DDisplay.html">Object2DDisplay</a>
         and the agents inhabiting the Object2DTorus would have to implement
         the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/Drawable.html">Drawable</a>
         interface.</a>
