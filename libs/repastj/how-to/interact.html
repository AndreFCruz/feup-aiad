         A user can interact with a non-batch Repast simulation through the
         gui. The gui allows the user to start, stop, pause, setup, and exit a
         simulation through the toolbar. The table below lists the toolbar
         buttons and their functions.

      <ol>
         <li>
            <strong>Start Multi-Run</strong>: The start multi-run button starts
            a batch run of a simulation. See <a href="./multirun.html">How to
            Use the Multi-Run</a> for more details.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Start</b>: The start button starts the simulation when it is
            paused or has not yet been started, iterating through the scheduled
            behavior.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Step</b>: The step button starts the simulation when it is
            paused or has not yet been started, iterating through a single
            iteration the scheduled behavior.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Initialize</b>: The initialize button starts the simulation but
            pauses before iterating any scheduled behavior. Only the
            initializing code is executed in this case.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Stop</b>: The stop button stops the simulation.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Pause</b>: The pause button pauses the simulation.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Setup</b>: The setup button &quot;sets up&quot; the simulation
            by executing the user defined setup code.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Load Model</b>: The load model button pops up a dialog allowing
            the user to specify a model to load.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>View Settings</b>: The view settings button will display the
            various model settings panel if it is hidden or destroyed.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Exit</b>: The exit button will shutdown the simulation and exit.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         To run a simulation you would click either the start, step or
         initialize buttons. If you click the initialize button, you would then
         click step or start. When you want to stop the simulation and then run
         it again, you click stop and then the setup button.
      </p>
      <p>
         In addition, if the model has followed the get/set method pattern (see
         <a href="./model.html#getset">How to Build a Model</a> and <a href=
         "./params.html">How to use Parameters and Parameter Files</a>) the
         user will also be able to see and set the initial parameters of a
         simulation. The initial parameters will appear in the settings window
         on the tab entitled &quot;Parameters&quot; into which the user can see
         the default starting parameters and enter new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
         Also in the settings window are the Custom Actions tab and the Repast
         Actions tab. The Custom Actions tab will contain any sliders, buttons,
         or checkboxes that the simulation author has defined. You can interact
         with the model while it is running through these sliders, buttons, and
         checkboxes.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Repast Actions tab looks like:
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The first two buttons allow you to make a movie or take a snapshot.
            Clicking on one of these buttons will bring up a dialog containing
            further information and choices.
         </li>
         <li>
            The third button will bring up a dialog for creating an sequence
            chart. (This functionality is provisional at this time.)
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;In Alpha Order&quot; check box controls the order of the
            parameters in the parameters tab. If it is checked the parameters
            will appear in alphabetical order. Otherwise they will appear in
            the order they are defined in the model.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;Stdout to Console&quot; check box determines if standard
            output (output from &quot;System.out.println&quot;) will be
            captured by the Repast console.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;Stderr to Console&quot; check box determines if standard
            error (output from &quot;System.err.println&quot;) will be captured
            by the Repast console.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;RngSeed in Defaults&quot; checkbox determines whether the
            current random number seed will be included as a default value
            either when written to a file or set as the current default.
         </li>
         <li>
            &quot;Update Probes&quot; determines whether or not any probed
            objects have their displayed properties updated in real-time or
            not.
         </li>
         <li>
            &quot;Show custom charts&quot; determines whether or not any custom
            charts created for this model using the &quot;create / edit
            charts&quot; button are automatically created and displayed when
            this model is run.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;Set As Default&quot; button will set the current
            parameters as the default until Repast is exited. This means that
            whenever the setup button is pressed these new defaults will be
            used rather the initial parameters.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;Write Parameters&quot; button will write the current
            parameters to a file so that can be loaded later.
         </li>
         <li>
            The &quot;About&quot; button displays a typical about dialog giving
            some further information about Repast.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         A user may also probe objects in the simulation provided those objects
         implement the get/set method pattern and whose displays are added to
         the DisplaySurface as probeables (see <a href="./display.html">How to
         Create Displays</a>). To probe an object, pause the simulation, and
         left click on the object in the display. The probeable state of all
         the objects underneath the cursor should appear in windows similar to
         the &quot;Parameters&quot; tab in the settings window, and their
         properties can be set in the same way (i.e. changing the property and
         pressing enter).
      </p>
      <p>
         Displaying a simulation can be one of the slowest parts of a
         simulation. Repast will not update the display if the display window
         is minimized, allowing for dynamic display updates. (Of course, these
         kind of updates can be set explicitly through a Schedule.) When the
         window is displayed again it will update in the usual manner.
