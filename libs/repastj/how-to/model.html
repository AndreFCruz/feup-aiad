		This document describes how to build Repast models using the SimModelImpl 
		class. Such models are more complicated to code, but can take fuller advantage 
		of Repast's capabilities. This document is intended for users whose models 
		require such capabilities or who have some experience in writing agent-based 
		simulations. Other users should see <a href="./simplemodel.html">How to Build a 
			Repast Model - 1</a> if you have not already.<p>
		Note: This how to is best read together with the source code from the sample 
		simulations.<p>
			<a name="overview"></a><b>Overview</b><br>
		The kinds of simulations that can be written using Repast fall into two broad 
		categories: batch-run, and non-batch run. A batch run simulation reads in a 
		specially formatted parameter file detailing the starting and ending values of 
		a model's parameters, how to increment these parameters and the number of runs 
		to complete. The simulation then begins to run without user interference.<p>
		A non-batch run requires a user to start and stop a run through a graphical 
		user interface, and allows the user to graphically set starting parameters. In 
		addition a non-batch simulation allows a user to graphically display and 
		manipulate (i.e. probe) an agent's state during the course of a run, as well as 
		the models.<p>
		What follows explains the basics of how to write both these kinds of 
		simulations, paying special attention to what must done for a model to set the 
		initial parameters from a parameter file, to allow a user to graphically set 
		starting parameters, and to allow probing to occur.<p>
			<a name="agent"></a><b>The Agent</b><br>
			Both batch and non-batch run simulations are largely similar. A typical 
			simulation of either kind written with Repast will have at least two classes 
			written by the user, the agent class and the model class. (See the source code 
			to the sample simulations for detailed examples). The agent class will be 
			largely simulation specific, although Repast does provide some minimal (at this 
			time) support for cooperation type agents, through the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/games/GameAgent.html">
				GameAgent</a> interface and the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/games/Game.html">
				Game</a> abstract class. If the agent is to be displayed, it should 
			implement one of the Drawable interfaces (see <a href="./display.html">How To 
				Create Displays</a> for more). If a user wishes an agent to be probeable, 
			that is, have its state graphically displayable and manipulable, the agent must 
			be coded using the <a href="#getset">Accessor</a>
		method pattern.<p>
			<a name="model"><b>The Model</b><br>
				A model, such as SugarModel.java or EnnModel.java (in 
				repast/demos/sugarscape/src/src/uchicago/src/sim/sugarScape and 
				repastdemos/enn/src/src/uchicago/src/sim/enn respectively) sets up and controls 
				both the representational and infrastructure parts of a Repast simulation. All 
				Repast simulation models must implement the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimModel.html">
					SimModel</a> interface. Repast provides an abstract class <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimModelImpl.html">
					SimModelImpl</a> that partialy implements this interface and it is expected 
				that most if not all models will extend this class.<p>
					Assuming then that a user is writing his or her own model that extends <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimModelImpl.html">
						SimModelImpl</a>
				, a typical model class should have the following parts:<p>
					<ul>
						<a name="vars">
							<li>
								<b>Infrastructure and Representation Variables</b> The variables contained by a 
								typical model class will be of both the infrastructure and representational 
								type. Infrastructure variables will be such things as a <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">
									Schedule</a>, collection classes for agents and so forth. For example, 
								SugarModel.java has a Schedule variable and a DisplaySurface for displaying the 
								agents and their environment. The largest portion of the representation 
								variables will be initial parameters for a run of this model. For example, 
								SugarModel contains a numAgents variable that is used to set the number of 
								sugar agents in a simulation run.<p>
									Any model that extends <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimModelImpl.html">SimModelImpl</a>
								also inherits the rngSeed variable which can be accessed through getRngSeed and 
								setRngSeed.<p>
									<a name="template">
								</p>
							<li>
								<b>Repast Template Methods</b><br>
								These template methods, although not required by the SimModel interface divide 
								the infrastructure and representation setup process into coherent groups. 
								Consequently, a user is encouraged but not required to structure their models 
								using these three methods.<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b><tt>private void buildModel()</tt></b> The buildModel() method is 
											responsible for creating those parts of the simulation that represent what is 
											being modeled. This is largely model specific. Nevertheless, The agents and 
											their environment are typically created here, together with any optional data 
											collection objects. Of course, this method may call other methods to help build 
											the model. SugarModel constructs all the SugarAgents and the SugarSpace in 
											buildModel() using the initial parameters. See <a href="./data.html">How To Collect 
												Data</a> for more on setting up and collecting data.<p></p>
										<li>
											<b><tt>private void buildDisplay()</tt></b> buildDisplay() builds those parts 
											of the simulation that have to do with displaying the simulation to a user. A 
											batch run model will probably not have this method. SugarModel builds both the 
											display for the agents and for the graphing classes here. The actual creation 
											of a DisplaySurface object should occur in the setup() method however. See <a href="./display.html">
												How To Create Displays</a> for more on creating displays, and <a href="./chart.html">
												How to Create Charts</a> for more on creating charts.<p></p>
										<li>
											<b><tt>private void buildSchedule()</tt></b> buildSchedule() builds the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">
												Schedule</a> that is responsible for altering the state of the simulation. 
											What this means is that the schedule is told what methods to call on which 
											objects and when. See <a href="./scheduler.html">How to Use a Schedule</a> for 
											more information. The source code to all the demonstration models provides good 
											examples of this and the API documentation for <a href=".../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">
												Schedule</a> should be straight forward.<p></p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<a name="getset">
										<li>
											<b>Get and Set Accessor Methods</b><br>
											First some background on how a model gets instantiated through the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimInit.html">
												SimInit</a> class, either as a command line argument or via its own main 
											method. (See <a href="./simstart.html">How to Run a Simulation</a> for more 
											information on a simulation starts using SimInit). When a non-batch simulation 
											is started through SimInit, a Controller object is created to control the 
											running of that model. If the name of the model was passed in as an argument to 
											SimInit, the Controller calls getInitParam() on the model and receives a list 
											of initial parameters that can be displayed for modification. (The same occurs 
											when a model is loaded through the load model dialog.) In order to display the 
											value of these parameters the controller determines if the model has 
											implemented get and set methods for that parameter. If so, the controller calls 
											the get method and displays the result to the user. When a user graphically 
											modifies one of these parameters the corresponding set method is called with 
											the new value as an argument. A typical get and set accessor method pair might 
											look like:<br>
											<code>
												<pre>
public int getNumAgents() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return numAgents;
}<br><br>
public void setNumAgents(int numAgents) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.numAgents = numAgents;
}
</pre>
											</code>Consequently, if a user wants to display some initial starting parameter 
											and have this parameter be modifiable, the name of the parameter must be 
											returned by the getInitParam() method and the model must contain the 
											appropriate get and set methods. For example, if a modeler wants a parameter 
											that contains the number of initial agents to be displayable, and modifiable, 
											some String such as "numAgents" must be present in the array returned by 
											getInitParam and the model must have a getNumAgents method and a setNumAgents 
											method. The source code to the example simulations all follow this pattern and 
											are good examples of it.<p>
											Probing objects (agents, environment and so forth) during the course of a 
											simulation run requires that the same accessor pattern be present. In these 
											cases, however, only the get method need be present for the variable to be 
											displayed. For example, an agent has a variable sugar that tracks the amount of 
											sugar that this agent has collected. The author of this simulation would like 
											to be able to probe this agent and have this variable displayed during the 
											course of a simulation run. In order for the value of the sugar variable to be 
											displayed, the agent must have a getSugar method. If the agent has no setSugar 
											method then "Sugar" is considered read-only and will be displayed as such in a 
											field entitled "Sugar:". If the agent has both getSugar and setSugar methods 
											then value of the Sugar variable will be able to be modified by the user during 
											the course of a simulation run.<p>
												You can limit what can be probed on non-models (agents, environments and so 
												forth) by implementing the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/CustomProbeable.html">
													CustomProbeable</a> interface on these non-model objects. The 
												CustomProbeable interface contains a single method <tt>public String[] 
													getProbedProperties()</tt> that functions like a model's <tt>getInitParams()</tt>
											method. By implementing the interface and returning an array of Strings that 
											are the names of the properties you want probed, you can limit probing to only 
											those properties. For example, suppose getProbedProperties returns "Sugar", and 
											"Age". The probing mechanism would only look for and return values through 
											getSugar, setSugar and getAge, setAge methods. This inteface can be useful when 
											your agent extends other classes whose properties you do not want displayed. 
											The OvalNode agents in the jiggle demonstration simulation are a good examples 
											of this.<p>
											Typically, only Strings, booleans and numbers are probed. However, this does 
											not mean that only agent variables of these types can be the source of such 
											probes. Translation from one type to another can be done inside the get and set 
											methods. For example a get method may iterate over a Vector of values and 
											return those values as a comma delimited String and the set method may parse 
											such a String and insert those values into the Vector. The hypercycle 
											demonstration simulation is an example of this. However, if the probed 
											parameter is itself some non-String, numeric, or non-boolean class, the 
											parameter will be displayed as a button. Clicking on this button, will then 
											probe the parameter itself and display the results in a new window.<p>
												The default display type for parameters is a text field. If you wish to display 
												check boxes for boolean parameters or combo-boxes to delimit a range of 
												choices, then see <a href="./prop.html">How To Create Property Descriptors</a>

										<li>
											<b>Interface Required Methods</b><br>
											In order to implement the <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimModel.html">SimModel</a>
											interface a user's model must define the following methods (the model will 
											refuse to compile if these are not defined):<p>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<b><tt>public String[] getInitParam()</tt></b> getInitParam should return a 
														String array of the initial model parameters that a user wishes to be 
														displayable and manipulable.<p></p>
													<li>
														<b><tt>public void begin()</b></TT> begin() should intialize the model for the 
														start of a run. Consequently, the three build methods are called here, and any 
														displays are displayed. begin() is called whenever the start button (or the 
														step button if the run has not yet started) is clicked. All the demonstration 
														simulations implement this method and have good examples of it. In addition, 
														any objects you need to create that depend on parameter values can be created 
														here (<b>NOT</b> in setup).<p></p>
													<li>
														<b><tt>public void setup()</tt></b> setup() should "tear down" the model in 
														preparation for a call to begin(). setup() is called when the model is loaded 
														either through passing the model name as an argument to SimInit, or through the 
														load model dialog, and more frequently, whenever the setup button is clicked. 
														Setup should set any objects that are created over the course of the run to 
														null, and dispose of any DisplaySurfaces, graphs, and Schedules. While not 
														strictly necessary this should help prevent memory leaks and insure a clean 
														startup (calling System.gc() helps too).<p>
															The initial model parameters should be set to whatever defaults the user wants 
															to see initially, and a Schedule should be created here (i.e. <tt>schedule = new 
																Schedule(1);</tt>) and if the model is a gui model a DisplaySurface should 
															be created here as well (i.e. <tt>displaySurface = new DisplaySurface(this, "Heat 
																Bugs Display");</tt>
														).<p>
															Objects that rely on parameter values should <b>NOT</b>
														be created or setup here. Any parameter manipulation either through the user 
														interface or through parameter files occurs after setup() is called. As a 
														result your objects will be created using incorrect parameter values.<p></p>
													<li>
														<b><tt>public Schedule getSchedule()</tt></b> Returns the schedule associated 
														with the model. Typically this just returns the the model's schedule variable.<p></p>
													<li>
														<b><tt>public String getName()</tt></b> This should return the name of the 
														model. This name will be displayed as the title of the tool bar.<p>
														The relationship between the various tool bar buttons and the actual execution 
														of code is as follows. When the setup button is clicked, the code in the 
														setup() method is executed. When the initialize button is clicked, the code in 
														begin() is executed. When the step button is clicked, the code in begin() is 
														executed and any behavoir scheduled for the next tick is executed. When the 
														start button is clicked, begin() is executed, and the simulation enters a loop 
														where any behavoir scheduled for the next tick is executed, the tick count is 
														incremented and the next schedule behavoir is executed and so on until the user 
														clicks the stop or pause button.<p>
														<p></p>
													</li>

												<a name="custom">
											</p>
										<li>
											<b>The Custom Actions Tab</b> If you are creating a gui non-batch model, you 
											can also place buttons, sliders, and check boxes on the Custom Actions tab in 
											the settings window. You can use the buttons and so forth to alter the state of 
											the model, agents, environment and so forth while the simulation is running. 
											The demonstration simulations Heat Bugs, and Hypercycles have good examples of 
											how this is done. See <a href="./custom.html">How to Create Custom Actions</a> for 
											more information.<p>
												<a name="simspec">
											</p>
										<li>
											<b>Simulation Specific Methods</b> A model may have simulation specific methods 
											such as methods that calculate and return data to be written to a file. The 
											calc* methods in EnnModel.java for example.
											<p>
												<a name="main">
											</p>
										<li>
											<b>The Main Method</b> A model may also contain an optional main method. The 
											model may be started through this method or as an argument to 
											uchicago.src.sim.engine.SimInit on the command line. See <a href="./simstart.html">How 
												To Run a Simulation</a> for more details on the variuos ways to start a 
											Repast simluation.<p>
												If you chose to include a main method in your model, this main method should 
												create an instance of your model, of SimInit and then load your model with 
												SimInit instance. For example, <code>
													<pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {
  SimInit init = new SimInit();
  MyModel model = new MyModel();
  init.load(model, null, false);
}
</pre>
												</code>The above loads the Repast model MyModel with no parameter file and in 
												gui mode. However, you can also specify a parameter file and whether this 
												should be run in batch mode or not. See the api docs for <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/SimInit.html">
													SimInit</a>
											for the details.<p></p>
										</li>
					</ul>
				Both batch and non-batch models should follow this general structure, although 
				in the case of a batch model the buildDisplay method is not necessary.<p>
					<a name="batchparams"><b>Batch Parameters</b><br>
						The get/set method pattern is used differently by a batch model. Just as a 
						non-batch model's initial parameters can be displayed and manipulated through 
						its get and set methods, a non-batch model uses the same methods to set its 
						initial parameters from a parameter file. See <a href="./params.html">How To Use 
							Parameters and Parameter Files</a> for more information.
