            How to Use Vector GIS

      <p>
         Several packages have been used to add vector gis support to Repast.
         These are most notably <a href="http://www.geotools.org">Geotools</a>
         and <a href="http://www.vividsolution.com/jts/main.htm">Java Topology
         Suite</a> These provide the back and middle end support for the types
         of operations needed for gis. JTS implements the Simple Features
         Specification from the OpenGis Consortium, and Geotools provides data
         handling (the full geotools package includes much more). Repast&#39;s
         gis tools are basically adapters between these toolkits and the Repast
         toolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Gis Philosophy</b> These adapters take the philosophy that gis
         features can be represented as pieces of a network. A Point can be
         represented as a node, a polygon can be represented as a node and a
         linestring can be represented as an edge. So each of these feature
         types (as well as its &quot;multi&quot; counterpart) have the methods
         from those types in Repast as well as the basic geographic functions.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Use</b> In order to create a gis space in Repast, you need to
         create a Geotools datasource. There are several including shapefile,
         postgis, and gml. More are being added daily. For an updated view on
         what&#39;s available check out the <a href="http://www.geotools.org">Geotools
         website</a> . The simplest one is the ShapefileDataSource. To create
         one, you just need a shape file. It can either be a set of individual
         files or a zip file.
      </p>
      <p>
         So:
      </p>
      <p>
         <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>   ShapefileDataSource = new ShapefileDataSource(new 
    URL(&quot;file:///home/thowe/data/tomszips&quot;);</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This would create a DataSource from the directory:
      </p>
<pre>
/home
 /thowe
  /data
   tomszips.shp
   tomszips.dbf
   tomszips.shx

or

/home
 /thowe
  /data
   tomszips.zip
</pre>
      <p>
         Once you have the datasource, use the DataSourceHandler to extract the
         features.
      </p>
      <p>
         <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>   Feature[] f = ShapeFileHandler.getFeatures(datasource);</code> 
 
</pre>
      <p>
         You then create RepastGisFeatures from these. Each of the features has
         a constructor for Feature, so it&#39;s quite easy:
      </p>
      <p>
         <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>   DrawablePolygon p = new DrawablePolygon(f[0]);</code> 
 
</pre>
      <p>
         The next step is to add these features to a GisLayer. This is very
         similar to a layer in other gis contexts. It is a set of features
         which are connected (semantically, not necessarily physically).
      </p>
      <p>
         <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>   GisLayer layer = new GisLayer(LayerType.POLYGON); layer.add(p);</code> 
 
</pre>
      <p>
         At this point you have a complete layer of features. At this point,
         you could either just work with the data as it is, or add things such
         as neighborhooders. This allows you to easily solve the nearest
         neighbor problem. At the moment, the only neighborhooder we have for
         gis is Delaunay Triangulation, but others will follow. Of course, you
         could also use distance between features to solve the nearest neighbor
         problem.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Display</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         To display vector gis, you need to create a GisDisplay and add
         Displayable features to it. <code></code>
      </p>
<pre>
<code>   GisDisplay display = new GisDisplay(300); display.addLayer(layer);</code> 
 
</pre>
      <p>
         At this point, your display works just like any other Repast Display.
         Note that the constructor for GisDisplay only takes one Argument. This
         is because the y value for the size is scaled based on the x value.
