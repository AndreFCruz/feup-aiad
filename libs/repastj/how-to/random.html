      <a name="random"><b>The Random Class</b><br>
      The Random class (uchicago.src.sim.util.Random) provides default random
      number generation for Repast. Random encapsulates the <a href=
      "http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">colt</a>
      library&#39;s random number generation by consolidating all the random
      number distributions provided by the colt library into a single class.
      These distributions are wrapped as static instance variables. The intent
      here is two-fold: provide easier access to these distributions and more
      importantly to insure that each distribution uses the same random number
      stream, allowing for easily repeatable behavoir of random number
      generation.</a>
      <p>
         Random contains a variety of random number distributions as static
         instance variables as well as a few next* methods for returning the
         next psuedo-random value from a distribution. Before using any of the
         instance variable distributions, these distributions must be created
         via the appropriate create* method. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// initialize Random.uniform
Random.createUniform();

// Random.uniform is now initialized and can be used.
int index = Random.uniform.getNextIntFromTo(0, 100);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This creates a uniform distribution from which to draw random numbers.
         You can then draw random numbers from this distribution using the the
         appropriate methods. See the cern.jet.random package in the <a href=
         "http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/api/index.html">colt</a> documentation for the details of these
         methods. The actual random number generator is seeded on first use
         with the current timestamp. See below for more details on seeding the
         generator.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once created a distribution can be used anywhere in your code through
         the use of Random&#39;s static instance variables. So for example, if
         you create the Uniform distribution in your model&#39;s begin()
         method, you can access the same Uniform distribution in your
         model&#39;s agent code with <code>Random.uniform</code>. This instance
         variable should always be referenced as such, that is, as
         Random._distribution_name_, and not as the right hand side of an
         assignment. Assigning a variable in this way can lead to unpredictable
         results when setting the random seed. In short, code like this:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         and <b>never like this</b>:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Uniform myUniform = Random.uniform; <b>// This is dangerous. Don&#39;t do it!!!</b>
...
int index = myUniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         All but one of the distributions in Random are from the colt library.
         The instance variable name is the same as the corresponding colt
         object with the first character in lower case. For example, the
         cern.jet.Random.Zeta distribution is Random.zeta. See the
         cern.jet.random package in the <a href="../colt/index.html">colt</a>
         library documentation for more information about these distributions,
         and how to draw random numbers from them. The next* methods can be
         used as is, without creating a distribution before hand. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>double s = Random.nextCauchy();
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Draws the next value from a Cauchy distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
         In all cases, the distributions use a MersenneTwister as the source
         for psuedo-random numbers. The MersenneTwister is a particularly good
         generator for simulations as it has an extremely large period. This
         generator is seeded on first use with the current timestamp. However,
         Random also allows you to set and get the random seed as well as the
         random number generator associated with that seed. Setting a new seed
         with <code>Random.setSeed</code> will create a new MersenneTwister
         with the specified seed and <b>invalidate</b> any previously created
         distributions. If you wish to use a distribution after the seed has
         been set, you must create it as described above. Consequently, the
         following is correct code:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Random.createUniform();
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
...
Random.setSeed(1L);
Random.createUniform();
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         but this is <b>not</b>:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Random.createUniform();
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
...
Random.setSeed(1L);
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10); <b>// This won&#39;t work</b>
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Calling a Repast model&#39;s setRngSeed method will also set
         Random&#39;s seed, as will setting the seed through the
         parameter&#39;s panel of a gui model. Once the seed has been set all
         the distributions will use the same random number stream and
         repeatable randomness can be easily achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that Random creates a default random number generator using the
         current timestamp as the seed. If you do not explicitly set your own
         seed, the distributions created via the create* calls will use this
         default generator.
      </p>
      <p>
         The normal pattern of use then is to create the distributions you
         want, and having done so draw randon numbers from those distributions
         througout your code via Random&#39;s instance variables. For example:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Random.createUniform();
Random.createNormal(.5, .3);
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
double val = Random.normal.nextDouble();
</code>
</pre>
      <a name="custom"><b>Custom Random Number Generation</b><br>
      Custom random number generation still uses the colt library but bypasses
      Repast&#39;s Random class. You&#39;ll need to do this if you want to use
      distributions with independent random number streams (random number
      generators). The general idea here is to define some instance variables
      in your model of the appropriate distribution types, create your random
      number generators and then associate these generators with the
      distributions you want to use. For example:</a>
<pre>
import cern.jet.random.*;
import cern.jet.random.engine.MersenneTwister;
...

public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {
  
  Normal myNormalDist;
  Uniform myUniformDist;

  ...

  public void begin() {
    MersenneTwister generator1 = new MersenneTwister(123);
    MersenneTwister generator2 = new MersenneTwister(321);

    myNormalDist = new Normal(1.0, 1.0, generator1);
    myUniformDist = new Uniform(generator2);
  }

  ...

  public void someMethod() {
    int index = myUniformDist.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
    doubl val = myNormalDist.nextDouble();
 }
}

</pre>
      <p>
         The important part here is the creation of two different
         MersenneTwisters. This will provide two different random number
         streams to the distributions. You can parameterize the seeds to these
         distributions and make them available to be set via the user interface
         or through a parameter file, by providing get and set methods for two
         seed values. You would then use the seed variables to seed the
         MersenneTwisters in place of &quot;123&quot; and &quot;321&quot;
         above. If the seeds are user specifiable, its also important to create
         the distributions in the begin() method rather than the setup()
         method. Any parameter changes will occur after setup() has been called
         and so creating your distributions there will ignore any parameter
         changes.
