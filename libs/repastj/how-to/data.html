      <p>
         Data collection is handled primarily through the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/DataRecorder.html">DataRecorder</a>
         object which can record data from a variety of sources and write that
         data out in tabular format to a file. The Enn (Endogenous
         Neighborhood) demonstration simulation (in repast/demo/enn) has a good
         example of how to use a DataRecorder object and should be explored in
         conjunction with this document. In addition to the DataRecorder class,
         some other options for data collection are described at the end of
         this document.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using a DataRecorder is a matter of creating it, adding data sources
         to it, and then scheduling records and file writes. The following is
         an example of creating the DataRecorder variable recorder. Creating a
         DataRecorder looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>recorder = new DataRecorder(&quot;./data.txt&quot;,
         this);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         or to add an optional header comment to the output file:
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>recorder = new DataRecorder(&quot;./data.txt&quot;, this,
         &quot;A Comment&quot;);</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         The first argument is the name of the file to write the data out to,
         the second is the model associated with the recorder (and so the
         argument is &quot;this&quot; given that the recorder is created within
         the model). In the second example, the final argument is an optional
         header comment. Once constructed the DataRecorder queries the model to
         determine if the simulation is running in batch mode. If so, the data
         recorder will write all the data to a single file keeping track of the
         run number and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
         Creating and adding data sources to the DataRecorder tells the
         DataRecorder where to find the data to record. The DataRecorder will
         record the data from these sources when it is sent the record()
         message, usually by the scheduling mechanism. The source of data for
         DataRecorder is typically a method call on some object, or the value
         of some instance variable. The actual sources for data can be of two
         types: numbers (ints, floats, longs, doubles) and objects (Strings
         etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
         In order for the DataRecorder to know how to work with the wide
         variety of possible data sources, these method calls or instance
         variables must be wrapped in one of two interfaces - NumericDataSource
         or DataSource, where NumericDataSource is for numeric datasources and
         DataSource is for anything else. The <code>NumericDataSource</code>
         interface has a single method: <code>public double execute()</code>,
         and the <code>DataSource</code> interface also has a single method:
         <code>public Object execute()</code>. Wrapping your data source in one
         of these interfaces entails creating a class that implements one of
         the above interfaces and returning the data you wish to record from
         the execute method. Like BasicActions, you can create these classes by
         hand or have Repast dynamically create them for you. An example
         follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  private int numAgents;
  private Space space;
  private DataRecorder recorder;

  ...

  class NumDataSource implements NumericDataSouce {
    public double execute() {
      return numAgents;
    }
  }

  class ObjDataSource implements DataSource {
    public Object execute() {
      return space.getData();
    }
  }

  private void buildModel() {
    recorder = new DataRecorder(&quot;./data.txt&quot;, this);
    recorder.addNumericDataSource(&quot;numAgents&quot;, new NumDataSource());
    recorder.addObjectDataSource(&quot;SpaceData&quot;, new ObjDataSource());
    ...
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here, we have implemented two data sources as inner classes to our
         model. The first, NumDataSource, merely returns the value of the
         numAgents ivar. The second, ObjDataSource, calls a method on some
         hypothetical Space object that returns an Object for recording. We
         then add these DataSources to the recorder in the buildModel() method.
         Having added the DataSources, the execute() methods of these
         DataSources will be called whenever we call DataRecorder.record().
         (You could also use anonymous inner classes here in place of teh
         explicit inner classes ObjectDataSource and NumDataSource.)
      </p>
      <p>
         If you wish Repast to create a class that implements one of these
         interfaces for you, the code looks like:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  private int numAgents;
  private Space space;
  private DataRecorder recorder;
  ...

  public int getNumAgents() {
    return numAgents;
  }

  public String getSpaceData() {
    return space.getData();
  }


  private void buildModel() {
    recorder = new DataRecorder(&quot;./data.txt&quot;, this);
    recorder.createNumericDataSource(&quot;numAgents&quot;, this, &quot;getNumAgents&quot;);
    recorder.createObjectDataSource(&quot;SpaceData&quot;, this, &quot;getSpaceData&quot;);
    ...
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here, we create the DataSources and add them with method calls to the
         DataRecorder object. The create* methods of the DataRecorder takes a
         label for the data to be recorded, an object reference, and the name
         of the method to call on that object that will return the data. So, in
         the above, Repast creates a NumericDataSource object whose execute
         method calls getNumAgents(). The createObjectDataSource works in a
         similar way. The results of either method of creating DataSources, by
         hand or dynamically, are comparable. However, with dynamic creation
         such errors as mis-spelling the method name argument in the create*
         call will not be caught until runtime.
      </p>
      <p>
         For NumericDataSources you can also specify the number of digits both
         before and after the decimal point that you wish to record. So for
         example, <code>recorder.createNumericDataSource(&quot;numAgents&quot;,
         this, &quot;getNumAgents&quot;, 3, 4)</code> will record 3 digits
         before the decimal point and 4 after. If the DataSource produces
         3333.22222222, the value 333.2222 will be recorded. An argument of -1
         will record all the digits, so
         <code>recorder.createNumericDataSource(&quot;numAgents&quot;, this,
         &quot;getNumAgents&quot;, -1, 4)</code> will record 3333.2222. Note
         that the number is not truncated, but rounded according to standard
         rules for rounding floating point numbers. See the API <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/DataRecorder.html">documentation</a>
         for more info on the DataRecorder class.
      </p>
      <p>
         The actual data collection via the record() method and writes of the
         recorded data to a file via writeToFile() are scheduled just like any
         other methods to be scheduled. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(0, new BasicAction() {
  public void execute() {
    dRecorder.record();
  }
});

schedule.scheduleActionAtEnd(dRecorder, &quot;writeToFile&quot;);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         tells the scheduling mechanism to call the record() method on the
         DataRecorder variable dRecorder every tick beginning at 0. As
         mentioned above dRecorder then queries its data sources in the manner
         described above and records the result. The above also tells the
         scheduling mechanism to call the &quot;writeToFile&quot; method on
         dRecorder. dRecorder then writes the collected data to the file
         specified when the dRecorder was constructed, appending the data if
         data has already been written during this run. The output file begins
         with a header giving model parameters for this run, followed by the
         data in tabular format. For example
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>RngSeed: 948816295132<br>
         numAgents: 100<br>
         maxAge: 120<br>
         <br>
         &quot;tick&quot;,&quot;Avg. Age&quot;<br>
         0.0,33<br>
         1.0,33<br>
         2.0,32<br>
         3.0,40<br>
         ...</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         The output file in a batch run is slightly different. There, any
         constant parameters are recorded in the header as is the starting time
         of the batch run. Any dynamic parameters as defined in the batch
         parameter file are recorded in the body of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can also change the delimiter for the recorded data with the
         <tt>setDelimiter(String val)</tt> method. The default delimiter is
         &quot;,&quot; and so by default recorded data will look something like
         that above. Changing the delimimter to a &quot;:&quot; for example,
         will result in:
      </p>
      <p>
         <code>RngSeed: 948816295132<br>
         numAgents: 100<br>
         maxAge: 120<br>
         <br>
         &quot;tick&quot;:&quot;Avg. Age&quot;<br>
         0.0:33<br>
         1.0:33<br>
         2.0:32<br>
         3.0:40<br>
         ...</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Note</b> that data is stored in memory until the writeToFile call
         at which point it is flushed. If you are experiencing memory problems,
         write your data to a file more frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Additional Ways to Collect Data</b><br>
         In addition to the DataRecorder there are several other options for
         recording data from a Repast simluation. For the ways to record
         network data, see <a href="./network.html">Network Models</a>.
         Recording data via an <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/ObjectDataRecorder.html">ObjectDataRecorder</a>
         is described below.
      </p>
      <p>
         An ObjectDataRecorder records arbitrary objects to files as Strings
         together with an optional comment. Typically, this comment will be the
         tick count, but need not be. An ObjectDataRecorder is constructed much
         like a DataRecorder object with a fileName and associated model.
         Unlike a DataRecorder an ObjectDataRecorder has no data sources, and
         records an arbitrary object when instructed to do so via its record()
         method.
      </p>
      <p>
         In non-batch mode, a file header will be written that includes all the
         model&#39;s properties and the values of these properties. These
         values will be the value at the time the first call to write is made,
         allowing the user to manipulate the parameters after setting up but
         prior to running the model. Consequently, your initial model
         parameters should only be changeable via the user or through a
         parameter file. If not, the file header may be inaccurate. The actual
         data will be written as a block where the block includes the optional
         comment as a header, followed by the String representation of the
         object itself. This String representation is acquired via the
         object&#39;s toString() method.
      </p>
      <p>
         In batch mode, any constant model parameters will be written in the
         file header. The data block will include the value of any dynamic
         parameters, the run number, as well as the optional comment (again,
         typically the tick count), together with the String representation of
         the Object to be recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
         Data is recorded by an ObjectDataRecorder via its record() method and
         written to a file via its write() method. See the API <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/ObjectDataRecorder.html">docs</a>
         for more information.
