         This document describes how to create and use sequence graphs,
         histograms, and plots in your own simulations. The Sugar Scape, Mouse
         Trap, and JinGirNew models each contain examples of charting, and can
         be used in conjunction with this document.
      </p>
      <p>
         Charting in Repast is done through four classes:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <a href=
            "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenSequenceGraph.html">OpenSequenceGraph</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            <a href=
            "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/NetSequenceGraph.html">NetSequenceGraph</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            <a href=
            "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenHistogram.html">OpenHistogram</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            <a href=
            "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Histogram.html">Histogram</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            <a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Plot.html">Plot</a>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Use the OpenSequenceGraph class to create, naturally enough, a
         sequence graph (some user defined values plotted versus time).
         NetSequenceGraph is similar but contains methods for easily plotting
         well-know network statistics vs. time. OpenHistogram is used to create
         a histogram whose bin ranges are dynamic, and Histogram to create a
         traditional standard histogram. The final class Plot can be used to
         plot any number of points on a graph and is usefull for plotting the
         results of a function where the input to that function is some
         simulation generated data. In additional you can zoom in on all five
         of these types of graphs. Details on each type follow below.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         OpenSequenceGraph
      </h3>
      <p>
         An OpenSequenceGraph will plot some user defined variable(s) versus
         time, that is, versus the tick count. Using an OpenSequenceGraph
         consists of creating an OpenSequenceGraph object, adding <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Sequence.html">Sequences</a> to it,
         scheduling updates on it, and displaying it. Creating a
         OpenSequenceGraph is well covered in the API <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenSequenceGraph.html">docs</a> and
         in the demonstration simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Sequence is an interface that you must implement and it serves as
         the source for the data to be plotted. It has a single method
         <tt>public double getSValue()</tt>. An OpenSequenceGraph works by
         calling the <tt>getSValue()</tt> method on all the <tt>Sequences</tt>
         it contains and plotting the returned value vs. the current tick
         count. A single OpenSequenceGraph can contain multiple Sequences. An
         example:
      </p>
<pre>
<code> 
OpenSequenceGraph graph = new
OpenSequenceGraph(&quot;Agent Stats.&quot;, this);

graph.setXRange(0, 200);
graph.setYRange(0, 200);
graph.setAxisTitles(&quot;time&quot;, &quot;agent attributes&quot;);

class AverageAge implements Sequence {
  public double getSValue() {
    double totalAge = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; agentList.length; i++) {
      Agent a = (Agent)agentList.get(i);
      totalAge += a.getAge();
    }
    
    return totalAge / agentList.length;
  }
}

graph.addSequence(&quot;Avg. Age&quot;, new AverageAge());
graph.addSequence(&quot;Avg. Vision&quot;, new Sequence() {
  public double getSValue() {
    double totalVision = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; agentList.length; i++) {
      Agent a = (Agent)agentList.get(i);
      totalVision += a.getVision();
    }
    
    return totalVision / agentList.length;
  }
});
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This creates a OpenSequenceGraph labeled &quot;Agent Stats.&quot; and
         associates it with the model referenced by &quot;this&quot;. The
         initial range of the x and y axes are set and are given titles. Two
         Sequences are then added to this graph. The first is created as a
         non-anonymous inner class and computes the average age. The second is
         created as an anonymous inner class and computes the average vision.
         They are added with appropriate labels and the SequenceGraph will take
         care of creating the appropriate legends for them. The methods used to
         add sequences above, that is, <code>addSequence(String name, Sequence
         sequence)</code> is just one version of the addSequence method. There
         are others that allow you to set the color and point type of the
         sequence. In addition, there are also methods that will create and add
         a Sequence for you given an object reference and the name of a method
         to call on that object. See the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenSequenceGraph.html">API</a> docs
         for details.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to update a SequenceGraph, you need to call its step()
         method. Typically this call would be scheduled every tick or at some
         interval. When this step() method is called on an OpenSequenceGraph it
         will call the getSValue method on all its Sequences and plot the
         results. See <a href="./scheduler.html">How to Use a Schedule</a> for
         more information on scheduling method calls for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
         An OpenSequenceGraph is displayed by calling its <tt>display()</tt>
         method. This is typically done in a model&#39;s <tt>begin()</tt>
         method. You can also write the plotted data out to a file in tabular
         format with a OpenSequenceGraph&#39;s <tt>writeToFile()</tt> method.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         NetSequenceGraph
      </h3>
      <p>
         The NetSequenceGraph is very similar to the OpenSequenceGraph: you can
         add your own sequences the manner described above and the graph itself
         is updated in the same way. (So if you haven&#39;t looked at the docs
         above for OpenSequenceGraph, you should.) However, NetSequenceGraph
         has some additional methods for plotting sequences of common network
         statistics such as density, component count and so forth. You can
         choose which of these &quot;pre-canned&quot; statistics to plot either
         through code or through the gui.
      </p>
      <p>
         In code, for example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>graph = new NetSequenceGraph(&quot;Network Stats&quot;, this, agentList);
graph.setAxisTitles(&quot;Time&quot;,&quot;Statistic Value&quot;);
graph.setXRange(0, 50);
graph.setYRange(0, numNodes);

graph.plotDensity(&quot;Density&quot;, Color.blue, graph.SQUARE);
graph.plotComponentCount(&quot;Component Count&quot;, Color.green, graph.SQUARE);
graph.plotClusterCoefficient(&quot;Cluster Coef.&quot;, Color.red, graph.SQUARE);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The constructor to a NetSequenceGraph takes a title for the plot, a
         reference to the model, and a list of the agents, that is, network
         nodes. The next three lines do some setup on the graph and are
         identical to their OpenSequenceGraph counterparts. The last three tell
         the graph to plot three network statistics, density, component count,
         and the cluster coefficient. In each case, the method takes three
         arguments, a legend, the color to plot the sequence with and the point
         type to plot the sequence with. The various plot* methods have also
         have versions with less arguments that use default values so you
         needn&#39;t specify the color or point style if you don&#39;t want to.
         See the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/NetSequenceGraph.html">API</a> docs
         for more info.
      </p>
      <p>
         To have the graph plot network stats via the gui, you&#39;ll need to
         create the graph and display it as described above. Once it is
         displayed you can click on the setup tab and add network stats via the
         gui.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that we are currently working on the robustness of these
         statistics. They should be used only as guides. The actual statistical
         analysis of your network should be done using established tools.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         OpenHistogram
      </h3>
      <p>
         The OpenHistogram class represents a dynamic bar chart, and allows the
         user to histogram data generated by a collection of objects. The
         histogram range, as displayed on the screen, is [lowerBound, maxValue]
         where the maxValue is calculated each time the graph is stepped. The
         individual bin ranges except for the final bin are [Math.floor(value),
         Math.ceil(value + interval)) where interval is calculated by (maxValue
         - lowerBound) / numBins. The final bin is inclusive at the top end.
         Note that the individual bin ranges are dynamic and as such there is
         never any under- or overflow. Histogram (see below) can be used for a
         more traditional histogram where the bin ranges are static.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using an OpenHistogram is much the same as an OpenSequenceGraph. The
         OpenHistogram is created, histogram items (i.e. the collection of
         bins) are created via the OpenHistogram, its updates are scheduled,
         and it is displayed. The creation of an OpenHistogram is well covered
         in the API <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenHistogram.html">documentation</a>,
         and in the demonstration simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
         HistogramItems are the individual set of bins displayed by a
         Histogram. For example, you may have one set of bins that displays a
         histogram of agents&#39; wealth and another that displays an
         environment&#39;s resources. HistogramItems are created created via an
         OpenHistogram&#39;s <tt>createHistogramItem(String name, List list,
         BinDataSource source)</tt> method. The name argument here merely tags
         and displays this HistogramItem with this name. The remaining two
         arguments provide the source of the data for the histogram as well as
         a means for getting that data.
      </p>
      <p>
         The mechanics of an OpenHistogram update are as follows. For each
         HistogramItem contained by the OpenHistogram, that HistogramItem
         iterates over the list specified when the HistogramItem was created
         (via Histogram.createHistogramItem) passing each Object in the list as
         an argument to the getBinValue method of the BinDataSource. This
         getBinValue method returns a double. All these doubles are then
         distributed across the bins according to the number of bins, the lower
         bound, and the maximum value. For example, given 2 bins, a lower bound
         of 0 and a maximum value of 4. The first bin will contain all the
         values from 0 up to but not including 2, and the final bin will
         contain all the values from 2 up to <em>and</em> including 4. The
         displayed bin value (i.e. the height of the bar in the chart) is the
         number of values that fall within this bin.
      </p>
      <p>
         A <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/BinDataSource.html">BinDataSource</a>
         is an interface with a single method <tt>getBinValue(Object o)</tt>
         that must be implemented by the modeler. As mentioned above the
         <tt>Object o</tt> passed into the getBinValue method is an Object from
         the List of objects passed in with OpenHistogram&#39;s
         createHistogramItem method. Each object in the list will be passed to
         this <tt>getBinValue</tt> method during an update. The following
         example from SugarModel.java should help to make things clear.
      </p>
<pre>
<code>bar = new OpenHistogram(&quot;Agent Wealth Distribution&quot;, 10, 0);

bar.setYRange(0, 100.0);

BinDataSource source = new BinDataSource()  {
  public double getBinValue(Object o) {
    SugarAgent agent = (SugarAgent)o;
    return agent.getSugar();
  }
};

bar.createHistogramItem(&quot;Wealth&quot;, agentList, source);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This creates a new OpenHistogram called &quot;Agent Wealth
         Distribution&quot; that contains 10 bins and lower bound of 0. The
         initial range of the y axis is set as 0 - 100. The x range is
         automatically set dependent on the number of bins, and what is being
         histogrammed. The BinDataSource source merely returns the amount of
         sugar that the SugarAgent passed into the getBinValue method has. A
         HistogramItem called &quot;Wealth&quot; that gets its data using the
         objects in agentList and the BinDataSource soure is then created. The
         effect here is to create 10 bins. Each bin will display how many
         agents have an amount of sugar within the range specified by that bin.
         The actual mechanics here is to iterate over every agent in agentList,
         passing each agent to the getBinValue method in the BinDataSource
         &quot;source&quot; which then returns the amount of sugar that agent
         has. The max value of these amounts determines the range of each bin
         by taking the max value - lower bound (in this case 0) and dividing it
         by the number of bins. The amount values are then placed into the
         appropriate bin, and the number of amount values in that bin is the
         height of the bar when the bin is displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
         OpenHistogram also contains methods to create a BinDataSource while
         creating the HistogramItem, given an object reference and the method
         name to call on that object. The method here is functions in place of
         the getBinValue(Object o) method of a BinDataSource, and thus it
         should taken an Object as a parameter and return a numeric value.
      </p>
      <p>
         Like an OpenScheduleGraph an OpenHistogram is updated using its step()
         method. Typically this call would be scheduled every tick or at some
         interval. When this step() method is called on an OpenHistogram the
         OpenHistogram is updated via the HistogramItems as described above.
         See <a href="./scheduler.html">How to Use a Schedule</a> for more
         information on scheduling method calls for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
         An OpenHistogram is displayed by calling its <tt>display()</tt>
         method. This is typically done in your models <tt>begin()</tt> method.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         Histogram
      </h3>
      <p>
         The Histogram class represents a dynamic bar chart and allows the user
         to histogram data generated by a collection of objects (such as the
         list of agents in your model). It differs from OpenHistogram in that
         its bin sizes are static, and thus there is the potential for over-
         and underflow. The histogram range is [lowerBound, maxValue] and the
         individual bin ranges are [Math.floor(value), Math.ceil(value +
         interval)) where interval is calculated by (maxValue - lowerBound) /
         numBins. Note that, unlike OpenHistogram, maxValue is not recalcuated
         each step, but is a value provided by the modeler.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using a Histogram is nearly identical to using an OpenHistogram. The
         Histogram is created, a HistogramItem (i.e. the collection of bins) is
         created via the Histogram, its updates are scheduled, and it is
         displayed. The creation of a Histogram is well covered in the API <a
         href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Histogram.html">documentation</a>,
         and in the JinGirNew demonstration simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
         The mechanics of a Histogram are identical to that of an OpenHistogram
         as is the creation of HistogramItems. See above, under OpenHistogram
         for the details, as well as for applicable examples. However, only a
         single HistogramItem can be created with a Histogram.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Histogram will also report over- and underflow by default as well as
         the mean and rms for the histogram. This can be turned off with the
         <tt>setStatsVisible(boolean val)</tt> method. The actual histogramming
         of data is performed by the colt library&#39;s Histogram1D class. This
         class provides a variety of methods for working with a one dimensional
         histogram. See the API docs for <a href=
         "../colt/hep/aida/ref/Histogram1D.html">Histogram1D</a> for the
         details. You can get a reference to Histogram&#39;s underlying
         Histgram1D using Histogram&#39;s <tt>getHistogram</tt> method.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>
         Plot
      </h3>
      <p>
         The plot class is a generic point plotting class and can be used to
         plot multiple points, e.g. plotting a function whose input is some
         simulation data. Use the plotPoint method to plot the points,
         updateGraph to display those points, and clear to clear the graph of
         all the points. For example:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Plot aPlot = new Plot(&quot;Test Plot&quot;);
aPlot.display();
aPlot.setConnected(true);

for (double i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  aPlot.plotPoint(i, Math.sin(i), 0);
}

aPlot.updateGraph();

aPlot.plotPoint(3.0, 4.0, 1);
aPlot.plotPoint(5.0, 1.4, 1);
aPlot.fillPlot();
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This creates a new Plot entitled &quot;test plot&quot; and then
         displays it. Calling setConnected(true) ensures that any plotted
         points will be connected. A sin wave is then plotted using plot point,
         the graph is updated with updateGraph() which will actually display
         the previously plotted points. A new series of points is then plotted
         and fillPlot() is called. fillPlot() will shrink the range of the
         axises so that the plotted points just fit and automatically update
         the graph. See the API <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Plot.html">docs</a> for more
         information.
