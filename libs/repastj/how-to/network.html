         The jiggle demonstration model (repast/demo/jiggle) is a simple
         example of a trivial network model, and the JinGirNew network model
         (repast/demo/jinGirNew) is a more complicated and realistic example.

      Network models in Repast are built around two basic interfaces: the <a
      href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/Node.html">Node</a> and the <a
      href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/Edge.html">Edge</a>. All the
      mechanisms for displaying, exporting and importing networks use these two
      interfaces and they should be the basis for your own network models.
      Repast provides default implementations of these interfaces, <a href=
      "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultNode.html">DefaultNode</a> and <a
      href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultEdge.html">DefaultEdge</a>
      that can be used as is or as the basis for your own network node and edge
      classes.</a>
      <p>
         The Node and Edge interfaces provide some simple methods for working
         with network nodes and edges. The API documentation should be clear,
         but the intention is that a Node keeps track of its incoming and
         outgoing edges as well as an optional label while an Edge keeps track
         of the Nodes to which and from which it is joined. In addition, an
         Edge also has methods for getting and setting the strength of the edge
         (typically to a value of 1), as well as an optional label and type.
         The type of the edge refers to the type of network that the edge
         defines (e.g. kinship, business and so forth).
      </p>
      <p>
         Creating a link (an Edge) between two Nodes can be done is either of
         two ways. The first way:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode(&quot;A&quot;);
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode(&quot;B&quot;);

// constructs a DefaultEdge from nodeA to nodeB
// with a default strength of 1
// nodeA --&gt; nodeB
DefaultEdge edge = new DefaultEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
nodeA.addOutEdge(edge);
nodeB.addInEdge(edge);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here two Nodes are created, and Edge is created linking nodeA to
         nodeB. This Edge is then added as an outgoing Edge to nodeA and as an
         incoming Edge to nodeB.
      </p>
      <p>
         The second and preferrable way is to use the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/EdgeFactory.html">EdgeFactory</a>
         class to automate edge creation and linking for you. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode(&quot;A&quot;);
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode(&quot;B&quot;);

// creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA to nodeB
EdgeFactory.createEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here EdgeFactory creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA and nodeB
         appropriately. EdgeFactory also as methods for setting edge strength
         labels and so forth during edge creation. In addition, you can also
         supply your own Edge implementing classes and EdgeFactory can use
         those. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode(&quot;A&quot;);
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode(&quot;B&quot;);

// creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA to nodeB
EdgeFactory.linkNodes(nodeA, nodeB, new MyEdge());
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here, EdgeFactory will link nodeA to nodeB using MyEdge. See the <a
         href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/EdgeFactory.html">API</a> docs
         for EdgeFactory for more info.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Node can get a reference to another Node via the Edge that connects
         them. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode(&quot;A&quot;);
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode(&quot;B&quot;);

EdgeFactory.createEdge(nodeA, nodeB);

// set up is complete. The following shows
// how to get a reference to nodeB given only
// nodeA.

ArrayList outEdges = nodeA.getOutEdges();

// we know there is only a single edge from nodeA
// because we only added one. Typically you&#39;d 
// iterate through or choose a specific edge based
// on some criteria.
DefaultEdge someEdge = (DefaultEdge)outEdges.get(0);

// the getToNode() method returns a Node so we need to
// cast to a DefaultNode. This someNode is in fact 
// nodeB.
DefaultNode someNode = (DefaultNode)someEdge.getToNode();

// label = &quot;B&quot;
String label = someNode.getLabel();
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         DefaultNode also provides many convenience methods that makes coding
         something like the above a bit shorter. See DefaultNode&#39;s <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultNode.html">API</a> docs for
         the details. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode(&quot;A&quot;);
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode(&quot;B&quot;);

// constructs a DefaultEdge from nodeA to nodeB
// with a default strength of 1
// nodeA --&gt; nodeB
DefaultEdge edge = new DefaultEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
nodeA.addOutEdge(edge);
nodeB.addInEdge(edge);

// set up is complete. The following shows
// how to get a reference to nodeB given only
// nodeA.

// we know there is only a single edge from nodeA
// because we only added one, and thus only a single
// ToNode.

DefaultNode = (DefaultNode)nodeA.getToNodes().get(0);

// label = &quot;B&quot;
String label = someNode.getLabel();
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Here the getToNodes() methods allows us to remove some of the code
         from the first example. DefaultNode contains many such methods.
      </p>
      <p>
         The DefaultNode provides much of the network type functionality you
         are likely to need. Consequently, you can compose your own network
         agents out of these DefaultNodes, either by inheritance or
         composition.
      </p>
      <p>
         A typical network model will treat the network nodes as the agents,
         and build these nodes and any necessary Edges as part of the
         buildModel() template method. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  ArrayList agentList = new ArrayList();

  ...

  private void buildModel() {
    // creates DefaultNodes and adds them to a list
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numAgents; i++) {
      DefaultNode node = new DefaultNode(String.valueOf(i));
      agentList.add(node);
    }

    // iterate through the agentList creating edges between 
    // the current node and the previous node. 
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; agentList.size(); i++) {
      Node node = (Node)agentList.get(i);
      Node prevNode = null;
      if (i == 0) {
        // current node is first node in list so
        // create an edge between it and the last node in
        // the list.
 prevNode = (Node)agentList.get(agentList.size() - 1);
      } else {
        prevNode = (Node)agentList.get(i - 1);
      }
      
      EdgeFactory.createEdge(node, prevNode);
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This is a simple example of how the structure of the initial network
         is created (adding edges to previous nodes). Real network models will
         use the same sort of code to create and add edges, but the criterion
         for adding edges will certainly be different. Together the Nodes and
         their Edges constitute the network, and all the nodes are placed in an
         ArrayList. Consequently this ArrayList represents the network as a
         whole. Many methods in the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetUtilities.html">NetUtilities</a>
         class operate on the entire network and expect to get such an
         ArrayList of nodes as an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="display"><b>Displaying Networks</b><br>
         Repast provides some fairly useful tools for network visualization.
         However, these tools are meant only to give you sense of the network
         and are not intended for network analysis. True network visualization
         and analysis should be done with third party tools such as Pajek or
         UCINet.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         Networks are displayed using the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/Network2DDisplay.html">Network2DDisplay</a>
         class. The Network2DDisplay class expects to be drawing a network
         composed of <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DrawableNonGridNode.html">DrawableNonGridNodes</a>
         and <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DrawableEdge.html">DrawableEdges</a>. As
         mentioned above, this network is encapsulated by a List of Nodes, in
         this case, DrawableNonGridNodes whose edges are of the DrawableEdge
         type. Typically, this List is not passed directly to the
         Network2DDisplay for drawing, but is wrapped in some sort of <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/GraphLayout.html">GraphLayout</a> first.
         The GraphLayout sets the x and y coordinates of the
         DrawableNonGridNodes according to some algorithm and then the
         Network2DDisplay displays the nodes at these coordinates. Repast comes
         with four types of GraphLayouts: <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/CircularGraphLayout.html">CircularGraphLayout</a>,
         <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/RandomGraphLayout.html">RandomGraphLayout</a>,
         <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/FruchGraphLayout.html">FruchGraphLayout</a>
         (lays out the nodes according to a modified implementation of the
         Fruchmen-Reingold graph layout algorithm), and <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/KamadaGraphLayout.html">KamadaGraphLayout</a>
         (lays out the nodes according to a modified implementation of the
         Kamada Kawai graph layout algorithm). More on using GraphLayouts later
         below.
      </p>
      <p>
         What all this means is that if you want your Nodes to be displayed
         they must implement the DrawableNonGridNode interface and your Edges
         must implement the DrawableEdge interface. Rather than having you
         implement the DrawableNonGridNode interface, Repast provides the <a
         href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultDrawableNode.html">DefaultDrawableNode</a>
         class. This class extends DefaultNode, so it contains all the network
         functionality described above; it is a DefaultNode. And it implements
         DrawableNonGridNode so it can be drawn with a Network2DDisplay. The
         actual drawing (as a rectangle, oval or whatever) of a
         DefaultDrawableNode is handled by a <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/NetworkDrawable.html">NetworkDrawable</a>.
         Repast provide two sorts of NetworkDrawables: a <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/OvalNetworkItem.html">OvalNetworkItem</a>,
         and a <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/RectNetworkItem.html">RectNetworkItem</a>.
         These will draw your DefaultDrawableNodes as ovals or rectangles
         respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
         While this mixture of DefaultNodes, DefaultDrawableNodes, and
         NetworkDrawables sounds quite complicated, in practice just a few
         lines of code are erequired to create nodes capable of being drawn by
         a Network2DDisplay and laid out by a GraphLayout. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>OvalNetworkItem item = new OvalNetworkItem(1, 10);
DefaultDrawableNode node = new DefaultDrawableNode(item);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The first line creates an OvalNetworkItem with x and y coordinates of
         1 and 10. The second line creates a DefaultDrawableNode and passes the
         OvalNetworkItem as part of the constructor. This means that the
         DefaultDrawableNode will be drawn as an oval. Moreover, once
         you&#39;ve passed the OvalNetworkItem in this way, you needn&#39;t
         worry about it again. In addition to the above, you can also set the
         NetworkDrawable for a DefaultDrawableNode with
         DefaultDrawableNode&#39;s setDrawable method. This allows you to
         easily change the shape etc. of the node while the model is running.
      </p>
      <p>
         The above is a simple example of how NetworkDrawables
         (OvalNetworkItems etc.) and DefaultDrawableNodes work together.
         Typically, you would create your own agent class that extends
         DefaultDrawableNode and then set the NetworkDrawable on that. Both the
         demonstration network models, jiggle (repast/demo/jiggle) and
         jinGirNew (repast/demo/jinGirNew) work in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
         As mentioned above, your Edges must implement the DrawableEdge
         interface. Repast provides a default implementation of this that
         should be fine for most purposes. See, <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DefaultDrawableEdge.html">DefaultDrawableEdge</a>
         for more info. Edge directionality is indicated by a small square on
         the displayed edge. The square is closer to the &quot;to&quot; node
         and farther from the &quot;from&quot; node. If the nodes are too close
         to each other to determine directionality, you can use the mouse
         (click and drag) to move the nodes further away. In addition,
         EdgeFactory has methods for automating the creation and linking of
         Nodes using DefaultDrawableEdges.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once you have constructed a Network2DDisplay it is handled like any
         other display. See <a href="./display.html">How to Create Displays</a>
         for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Network2DDisplay will layout DrawableNonGridNodes according to
         their x, y coordinates, and is not itself capable of doing any sort of
         graph layout. As mentioned above, you can use one of the graph layout
         classes to lay out your network for you. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>layout = new CircularLayout(agentList, xSize, ySize);
Network2DDisplay display = new Network2DDisplay(layout);
surface.addDisplayableProbeable(display, &quot;Network Display&quot;);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This constructs a CircularGraphLayout by passing it the list of agents
         (most likely a list of DefaultDrawableNodes) and the size of the
         display. This layout is then passed to Network2DDisplay and that
         display is then handled in the usual manner. See <a href=
         "./display.html">How to Create Displays</a> for more information. If
         the included graph layouts are not sufficient you can create your own
         using <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/AbstractGraphLayout.html">AbstractGraphLayout</a>
         as a base class.
      </p>
      <p>
         Graph layouts do not update themselves automatically every tick. You
         will need to schedule the updateLayout() method on your graph layout
         in order to update the layout. See <a href="./scheduler.html">How to
         Use a Schedule</a> for more info. FruchGraphLayout and
         KamadaGraphLayout calculate node coordinates based on edge
         connections, so whenever these connections change then updateLayout()
         will create a new layout. Conversely, the CircularGraphLayout will
         create the same layout regardeless of the structure of the network,
         and updateLayout() will only need to be called if the model itself
         changes the coordinates of the nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
         FruchGraphLayout and KamadaGraphLayout can be quite slow when laying
         out large networks. Consequently, you may want to update the layout
         infrequently. These two classes also have &quot;hooks&quot; in them to
         react to Repast toolbar (the bar with the start, stop, etc. buttons)
         button presses. This allows you to interrupt the layout by pressing
         stop, pause, or exit. Without this, your model may continue to finish
         network layout even though you have pressed pause. You can attach the
         layout to the toolbar buttons as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>Controller c = (Controller)getController();
c.addStopListener(graphLayout);
c.addPauseListener(graphLayout);
c.addExitListener(graphLayout);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         This code would typically be placed in your model&#39;s buildDisplay()
         method.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can also move the nodes around with the mouse by clicking on a
         node and dragging it. This is useful if the nodes are obscuring each
         other. Zooming in on parts of the network is also posssible. You do
         this by holding down the control-key and dragging the mouse to draw a
         box around the area you wish to zoom in on. After you&#39;ve defined
         the zoom area, press the &quot;z&quot; key to zoom. Press
         &quot;r&quot; to return the network to its normal state.
      </p>
      <p>
         <a name="io"><b>Importing and Exporting Network Data</b><br>
         Repast provides facilities for importing and exporting network
         data.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Importing Data</b><br>
         Network data is imported via the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a>
         class. Using NetworkFactory.getNetwork method, you can import a
         network from two file formats. The file description of the network is
         transformed into a list of Nodes and Edges of some user specified
         type. The supported formats are UCINet&#39;s dl format and the UCINet
         compatible Excel format.
      </p>
      <p>
         The matrix is assumed to be square for both the dl and Excel formats.
         For Excel, each worksheet is treated as a matrix, and any worksheets
         that do not contain matrices will cause an error. The worksheet name
         is treated as the matrix label unless the name begins with Sheet
         (Excel&#39;s generic worksheet name). The format for excel files is
         that imported and exported by UCINet. The first cell is empty, and the
         node labels begin on this first row in the second column. The column
         node labels begin in first column on the second row. The actual data
         begins in cell 2,2. For example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>             | first_label | second_label | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
first_label  | 0           | 1            | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
second_label | 1           | 0            | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
...          | ...         | ...          | ...
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         If the matrix has no node labels, Repast will expect the first row and
         column to be blank and for the data to begin in cell 2,2.
      </p>
      <p>
         An example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>List list = NetworkFactory.getNetwork(&quot;./network.dl&quot;, NetworkFactory.DL,
                                     MyNode.class, MyEdge.class,
                                     NetworkFactory.BINARY);
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         NetworkFactory will parse the network.dl file creating a list of Nodes
         that contain the appropriate Edges to other Nodes. In this case, all
         the nodes will be of the MyNode class and the edges of MyEdge class.
         This assumes you have defined a MyNode class that implements the Node
         interface and have defined a MyEdge class that implements the Edge
         interface. DefaultNode.class and DefaultEdge.class could have been
         substituted here as well. (The &quot;ClassName.class&quot; notation
         returns class information about a class.) The resulting List can be
         used just as if you had created the network by hand (as in the
         previous example). The final argument specifies the size of the matrix
         cell items (ij values). It can be one of NetworkFactory.BINARY,
         NetworkFactory.SMALL, or NetworkFactory.LARGE. Use BINARY if the ij
         values are 0 or 1, SMALL if the values are between -127 and 127 and
         LARGE for anything else. The difference in memory usage between BINARY
         and LARGE is enormous and specifying BINARY here can make the
         difference between being able or unable to actually import a network
         into Repast.
      </p>

         <b>Note</b>: The Excel format can only be used on windows and requires
         that you copy the ExcelAccessor.dll from repast/lib to your system

         <b>Exporting Data</b><br>
         Exporting data is done through the <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkRecorder.html">NetworkRecorder</a>
         class. NetworkRecorder records a network as a matrix or matrices in
         the appropriate format. It takes a list of Nodes and writes the
         corresponding adjacency matrix to a file. Three file formats are
         supported: UCINet&#39;s dl, Excel, and ASCII. The actual network
         matrix is written out in this format, although Repast records relevant
         non-matrix information as well: a file header containing the constant
         parameters for the model and a timestamp, and a block header that
         contains header information relevant to the network data recorded
         beneath it. The block header will contain the value of any dynamic
         model parameters at the time a network was recorded, as well as any
         user comments (typically the current tick count).
      </p>
      <p>
         The actual format of the file is as follows:
      </p>
<pre>
<code>file header

block_header_1
network data in the specified format

block_header_2
network data in the specified format
...
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         Specifying the format then specifies the format for the network data.
         The rest (file header and block header) will remain the same for all
         formats. The actual network data can easily be cut and pasted out of
         the file.
      </p>
      <p>
         ASCII format will record the matrix and the matrix label in comma
         delimited plain text. Excel format will store it in an Excel file in a
         format suitable for importation into UCINet.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Note</b>: Excel format should not be used as it is very time
         consuming and error prone to write to an Excel file. Use ASCII instead
         which is a plain text format suitable for importation into excel.
      </p>
      <p>
         An example,
      </p>
<pre>
<code>NetworkRecorder recorder = new NetworkRecorder(NetworkRecorder.DL,
                                              &quot;./myNetwork.dl&quot;,
           this);
...

recorder.record(nodeList, &quot;tick: &quot; + getTickCount(), NetworkRecorder.BINARY);
...
recorder.write();
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
         The first line creates a NetworkRecorder to record a network in dl
         format into the file myNetwork.dl, and passes it a reference to the
         model in which the recorder is constructed. The second line does the
         actual recording. It records the network(s) represented by the Nodes
         and their Edges in nodeList and appends the current tick count to the
         block header. The last argument refers to the size of the ij values,
         and works the same as for NetworkFactory.getNetwork (see above). The
         ij value recorded is that of the strength of the edge. By default this
         is 1 if an edge exists otherwise 0. recorder.record(..) should occur
         as part of a BasicAction to be scheduled for some sort of repeated
         execution. recorder.write() does the actual write of the data record
         by recored.record to the specified file (e.g. myNetwork.dl). Writing
         to disk is slow and so the call to recorder.write() should be done
         sporadically. See <a href="./data.html">How to Collect Data</a> from
         more on scheduling data collection.

         <a name="create"><b>Predefined Network Structures</b><br>
         In addtion to being used to import networks from a file, <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a>
         can also be used to create some common network structures. These are:
         a Square Lattice Network, a Random Density Network, and the classic
         Watts-Strogatz small world network (ring substrate). You create these
         networks using the appropriate methods in NetworkFactory. They operate
         similar to importing data. You provide the node and edge classes, as
         well as some network parameters, and you get back a network of the
         appropriate structure as a List of your node classes See <a href=
         "../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a>
