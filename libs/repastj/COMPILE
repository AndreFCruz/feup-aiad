To compile repast from cvs source, you'll need:

1. The contents of the repast_lib.zip archive in this directory.
   This contains the third-party libraries used by repast.

2. Ant, a java centric build tool. You can get this from 
   http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html

3. the latest version of the junit unit testing framework. You can get this
   from http://www.junit.org.

As mentioned above, repast uses ant as a replacement for make, and 
build.xml as the replacement for the makefile. You'll need to rename
the build.foo file in this directory to build.xml and make some
simple changes to your new build.xml. See build.foo for the details.

Once you've done that, you can compile repast from the console (unix
or dos terminal) by cd'ing to this directory and running ant
(i.e. typing ant at the prompt).

If you want to run the tests yourself, the classes are in
uchicago.src.sim.test and can be run from within junit the usual
way. See the junit docs for more.
