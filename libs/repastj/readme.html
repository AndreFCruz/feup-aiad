<p><b>Scope. </b>
The University of Chicago's Social Science Research Computing's Repast is a 
software framework for
creating agent based simulations using the Java language 
(<a href="http:./readme.html#requirements">requires</a> version 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/index.jsp">Java</a> 1.4 or greater).
It provides a 
library of classes for creating, running, displaying and collecting data
from an agent based simulation. In addition, Repast can take snapshots of
running simulations, and create quicktime movies of simulations.
Repast borrows much from the <a href="http://www.swarm.org">Swarm</a> 
simulation toolkit and can properly be termed "Swarm-like." In addition, 
Repast includes such features as run-time model manipulation via 
gui widgets first found in the
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape">Ascape</a>
simulation toolkit.<p> 

On a more technical level, Repast envisions 
a simulation as a state machine whose state is
constituted by the collective states of all its components. These 
components can be divided up into infrastructure and representation. The 
infrastructure is the various mechanisms that run the simulation, 
display and collect data and so forth. The representation is what the 
simulation modeler constructs, the simulation model itself. 
The state of the infrastructure is then the state of the 
display, the state of the data collection objects etc. The state of 
the representation is the state of what is being modeled, the current 
values of all the agents' variables, the current value of the 
space or spaces in which they operate, as well as the state of any other 
representation objects (e.g. aggregate quasi-independent "institution" 
objects). The history of the simulation as a software phenomenon is the
history of both these states, while the history of the simlulation as a 
simulation is the history of the representational states. In Repast as in
Swarm, any changes to the states of the infrastructural components and 
the representational components occur through a 
<a href="http:./docs/api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/Schedule.html">Schedule</a> 
object. In short then, Repast allows a user to build a simulation 
as a state machine in which all the changes to the state occur 
through a schedule. This provides clarity and extensibility both for the 
simulation writer/user as well as the software designer seeking to extend 
the toolkit.<p>

<p><b>Contents. </b>
This release consists of the core simulation library,  
<a href="./readme.html#simcore">repast.jar</a>, the
optional open source charting classes <a href="./readme.html#plot">
plot.jar</a>, some additional <a href="./readme.html#libs">libraries</a>, <a href="./readme.html#samples"> 
eight example simulations</a>, <a href="./readme.html#source">
source code</a> and <a href="./readme.html#docs">documentation</a>. 
<ul>
<li><a name="simcore"><b>repast.jar</b></a> contains the fundamemtal
simulation classes, such as the schedule mentioned above as well as classes
for displaying and collecting data. It must be included in the classpath
whenever a Repast simulation is run. repast.jar can be found in repast/lib
<p></li>

<li><a name="plot"><b>plot.jar</b></a> contains the optional charting classes.
This library is the open source charting component of the 
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Ptlomey</a> project.
It must be
included in the classpath if the simulation uses any of the Repast
graphing classes (<a href="http:./docs/api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenSequenceGraph.html">OpenSequenceGraph</a>,
<a href="http:./docs/api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/OpenHistogram.html">
OpenHistogram</a>, and 
<a href="http:./docs/api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/Plot.html">Plot</a>).
<p></li>
<li><a name="libs"><b>Additional Libraries</b></a> Repast requires some
additional libraries to run. colt.jar is the Colt library of scientific,
statistical, and numerical functions. The Colt homepage can found 
<a href="http://nicewww.cern.ch/~hoschek/colt/index.htm">here</a>. 
Repast uses the Colt library's implementation of the Mersenne Twister 
for random number generation, but the library can be used for much more.
jgl3.1.0.jar is an STL like library for Java of which Repast uses only a few
classes. Both colt.jar and jgl3.1.0.jar must be included in the classpath
of any repast simulation. jmf.jar, mediaplayer.jar, sound.jar,
mediaplayer.jar, multiplayer.jar are only required when a movie is
being created. Of these, Repast only uses jmf.jar, but Sun requires the
distribution of the entire set. All these can be found in the repast/lib
directory.<p>

<li><a name="samples"><b>Example Simulations</b></a> This release of
Repast comes with eight example simulations. See the readme in
repast/demo for more information. The example simulations can be found
in sub-directories to the repast/demo directory<p>

<li><a name="source"><b>Source Code</b></a> Repast comes with the source code
to all the classes found in repast.jar as well as the source to the sample
simulations. It can be found in repast\src.<p>

<li> <a name="docs"><b>Documentation</b></a> 
The Repast API
documentation can be found in repast\docs\api, or click <a
href="http:./docs/api/index.html">here</a>. Repast also comes with <a
href="http:./docs/how_to/how_to.html">Repast How-To</a> which provides
more detail on how to use RePast, as well as a 
<a href="./docs/how_to/faq.html">FAQ</a> containing answers
to some frequently asked questions..

<a name="repast"><h3>Why Repast</h3></a>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td>
The name Repast is an acronym for <i>REcursive Porous 
Agent Simulation Toolkit</i>. Our goal with Repast 
is to move beyond the representation of agents 
as discrete, self-contained entities in favor of a view of social actors 
as permeable, interleaved and mutually defining, with cascading and 
recombinant motives. We intend to support the modeling of belief systems, 
agents, organizations and institutions as recursive social constructions, 
where recursiveness includes the way in which longer duration processes 
define the constraints and opportunities available to shorter duration
social processes. The fuller goal of the toolkit is to allow
situated histories to be replayed with altered assumptions.  To achieve 
this goal, it will be necessary for Repast to provide a feast of advanced 
features, and it is toward that objective that we work.<p>
