SAJaS - Simple API for JADE-based Simulations (v0.92b, 2016-Mar-11)
=============================================

The Simple API for JADE-based Simulations (SAJaS) is a proposal to bridge the 
gap between MAS simulation and development. SAJaS enhances MABS frameworks 
with JADE-based features. While empowering MABS modellers with modelling 
concepts offered by JADE, SAJaS also promotes a quicker development of 
simulation models for JADE programmers. In fact, the same implementation can, 
with minor changes, be used as a large scale simulation or as a distributed 
JADE system. 
SAJaS provides, for certain kinds of applications, increased simulation 
performance, as compared to JADE.
