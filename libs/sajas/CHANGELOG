SAJaS - Simple API for JADE-based Simulations
=============================================

This is the change-log for SAJaS.


v0.92b, 2016-Mar-11
-------------------
- Added timer-based functionality as available in JADE agents (which supports features such as TickerBehaviour, WakerBehaviour and ACLMessage reply-by handling in FIPA protocols),
  although its use in SAJaS should be carefully considered and is not encouraged, given its impact on simulation performance.
- Solved issue with stopping the simulation (in both Repast3 and RepastS): agents now have a chance to take-down properly.
- Solved issue on agent scheduling/unscheduling: agents are no longer unscheduled when they have no ready behaviours.
  (Undesired side-effects were: agent removal from its context (RepastS), making it inaccessible for projections; no take-down operations for unscheduled agents.)
- Refactored the way agents are started, making the whole process more clear and more similar to JADE (though greatly simplified).


v0.91b, 2015-Oct-20
-------------------
- Solved bug with incorrect use of sajas.core.AID in some migrated JADE classes.
- Updated documentation on sajas.core.AID, which should be used by programmers only when explicitly instantiating this class.


v0.9b, 2015-Sep-1
-----------------
First version of SAJaS.
